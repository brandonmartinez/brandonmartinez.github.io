The other day, Joy and I were at Best Choice Market in downtown Ludington; as we were browsing their interesting selection of food, we found a cornish hen. I decided to get it and try it out.

I ended up making a rub out of some seasonings, let it sit overnight and marinate, then grilled it the next day. Honestly, it is probably one of the best things I've ever eaten.
