This past summer I had the pleasure of presenting at
[THAT Conference 2017](https://www.thatconference.com/sessions/session/11122 "THAT Conference | Gulp, Grunt, Webpack: What's a Dev to Choose? by Brandon Martinez")Â with
my talk titled
[Gulp, Grunt, Webpack: What's a Dev to Choose?](https://www.thatconference.com/sessions/session/11122 "THAT Conference | Gulp, Grunt, Webpack: What's a Dev to Choose? by Brandon Martinez").
In my session, I demonstrated two of the most popular JavaScript task runners,
[Grunt](https://gruntjs.com/) and [Gulp](https://gulpjs.com/), being used with
two of the most popular bundling systems, [webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) and
[browserify](http://browserify.org/), and how they can fit into your JavaScript
workflow.

If you were able to catch my presentation, thank you for coming out to support
me! If you didn't have the opportunity, or you want a refresher on the content,
then you're in for a treat: I recorded a streamlined version of my talk as a
screencast that can be seen over at
[the Skyline Technologies blog; check it out!](https://www.skylinetechnologies.com/Blog/Skyline-Blog/October_2017/gulp-grunt-webpack-what-is-a-dev-to-choose)

All of the slides and source can be found on my
[GitHub Repository](https://github.com/brandonmartinez/mm-gulp-grunt-webpack-comparison).

[slides can also be viewed on GitHub Pages](https://brandonmartinez.github.io/mm-gulp-grunt-webpack-comparison/slides/#/).
