Facebook recently launched a new feature for profiles and pages: [promoted posts](https://www.facebook.com/help/promote "Promoted Posts | Facebook Help Center"). They are meant to be a quick and easy way to get one of your posts in front of the eyes of not just your friends, but their friends as well.

Having a small [Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/photosbybrandonandjoy "Photos by Brandon & Joy on Facebook") myself, I thought it'd be worth trying out the new feature. I put together a small graphic that would fit nicely expanded on my page, gave it a quick tagline, and setup the promotion; here's what it looked like:

I configured the post to run over the weekend, with a spending limit of $10. As you can see, this got it in front of many eyes, quickly becoming our top post:

Facebook also gives a much more in-depth view of the promotion, showing that our reach was even further than the overall views:

Another interesting view is to see how it affected the page's "insights", or page traffic:

Obviously, this campaign faired quite well for us. But did it profit? Yes!

We do [photography as a hobby](http://www.photosbybrandonandjoy.com/ "Photos by Brandon & Joy"), but we try to make _some_ money off of it (albeit, not a lot). So, after spending $10, we only need to book 1 job to recoup our costs. Luckily, we picked up 3 or 4. Was this worth it? Heck yes!

This was a first experience with using the promoted post feature, and it is definitely something I would consider using again. Granted, I've heard from others in my area that they didn't fair as well, but as long as it's working for me I'll keep throwing one out there on occasion.

If you're interested in creating your own promoted post, I highly recommend checking out [Facebook's Help Center article](https://www.facebook.com/help/promote "Promoted Posts | Facebook Help Center") on the topic; it covers the most frequently asked questions and gives you ideas if using the feature is right for you.
