It's that time of year; today is the International Blue Beanie Day in Support of Web Standards (Monday, November 30th). To show my support, I have put together this awesome Blue Beanie Poss:

For more information, check out Jeffrey Zeldman's post, [Toque o' the Morning](http://www.zeldman.com/2009/10/25/toque-o-the-morning/). There you'll find a Photoshop file of the blue beanie, as well as more information on IBBDiSWS.

_The possum is from [That's Not a Cat, That's A Possum, by Rocksoft](http://rocksoft.wordpress.com/2009/05/05/thats-not-a-cat-thats-a-possum/). Also, you may be wondering ["why the possum?"](http://www.possumtales.com/)._
