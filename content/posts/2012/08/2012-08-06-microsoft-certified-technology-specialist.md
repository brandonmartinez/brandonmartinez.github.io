This past weekend, I took my first Microsoft Certification exam: _Accessing Data with Microsoft .NET Framework 4_.

Honestly, it was one of the hardest tests I've taken, but luckily I passed it.

As such, I have earned my first certification (ever), and can now be recognized as _Brandon Martinez, MCTS (Microsoft Certified Technology Specialist)_.

And can even put this neat logo on business cards, letterhead, etc:
