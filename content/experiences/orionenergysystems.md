Helped to develop and maintain an employee-centric web application with a team
of three other developers. In addition to helping implement Scrum
methodologies, I was able to help rapidly expand the functionality of their web
applications, providing valuable information and reporting tools to the company.

I believe in sharing knowledge with fellow team members to help enrich the
entire team and adopt new technologies. At Orion, I gave educational
presentations which covered topics such as data migration, web-oriented MVVM,
and object-oriented CSS.

Additionally, my work was done via telecommuting. Using numerous technologies,
such as Microsoft Lync, FogBugz, Trello, and two custom-built, always-on
"virtual presence" PCs, I was able to be a valuable team member and perform my
tasks equal to or above on-site expectations.
