I've been searching for this book for a long time. I read it sometime in high school, but had since forgotten what it was called.

For the past three or four years, I've tried remembering the book's name with no luck. On occasion, I would even try a Google search of content I remembered from the book, hoping to stumble across a summary of some sort or a posting by a fan of the book.

Well, all that searching has paid off. I finally found the book:

Honestly, I don't even remember if the book was all that good. I just know I liked it enough to keep searching for it from time-to-time, and that I'm glad I found it.

I think I'll open it up right nowâ€¦
