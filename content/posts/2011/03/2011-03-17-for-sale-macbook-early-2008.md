If you remember, I had a [little accident](https://www.brandonmartinez.com/2010/12/31/pro-tip-liquid-laptop/ "Pro Tip: Liquid + Laptop") with Joy's MacBook earlier this year. Well, since then, she's bought a refurbished MacBook Pro, so we no longer need the MacBook.

A few notes before I get started with specs and the like:

- As I said, we did have a bit of an accident with the laptop. A glass of soda spilled on the display and keyboard.
- The display currently has small speckles in the lower right corner from the damage. (picture below)
- While the computer still boots fine, it constantly wants to shut the display off. It does, however, run fine with an external display attached. (picture below)
- When an external display is **not** connected, it wants to go to sleep.
- The trackpad button does not click.

With all of that said, this computer either good for a headless computer, parts for another MacBook, or as a fix'r-up project.
