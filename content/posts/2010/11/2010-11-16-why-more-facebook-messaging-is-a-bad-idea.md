If you haven't heard, Facebook announced today that their messaging system was going to get a [major overhaul](http://mashable.com/2010/11/15/facebook-messaging-event/). Users will eventually get an _@facebook.com_ "email" address, based on their username (e.g.Â _brandonmartinez@facebook.com_). The platform revamp may sound like a great idea, but I can think of one good reason on why it's a bad idea.

I don't want my inbox to be filled with stuff like this:

As if regular spam isn't bad enough.
