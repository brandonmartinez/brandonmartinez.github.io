A small lifehack of mine for your Friday morning: easily straightening shirt collars, sleeves, and [placket, plain, and fly fronts](http://www.askmen.com/fashion/fashiontip_500/581b_the-anatomy-of-a-dress-shirt.html "The Anatomy of a Dress Shirt") with a flat iron.

If you have one of these hanging around your house, they'll soon become your dress shirts' best friend when you're in a time crunch:

Thankfully, my wife had two of them, so I've slowly claimed that one as my own. It's a quick and easy way to straighten a dress shirt out in the morning without having to get out the iron and ironing board:

To top it off, if you notice your shirt is a bit wrinkly _while it's on you_, no problem! You can straighten it right in place:

If you decide to straighten your shirt while it's on you, **please be careful!** You have been warned.

And there you have it: a quick and easy way to keep your dress shirts wrinkle free while in a time crunch.
