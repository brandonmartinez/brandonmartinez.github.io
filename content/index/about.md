Hey there! I'm Brandon – a 30-something geek working from home on the west coast
of Michigan. I live with [my wife, Joy](http://coffeejoymama.tumblr.com/), our
two sons ([Seth](http://www.sethmartinez.com/) and [Perry](http://www.perrymartinez.com/)),
and our daughter ([Poppy](http://www.poppynoellemartinez.com/)).

I’m currently working remotely for [Skyline Technologies](http://skylinetechnologies.com/)
out of Northeast Wisconsin as a senior software engineering consultant. I’m
primarily a C# .NET developer, but I’m also a highly-skilled web and UI
developer. For more info on my technical skills, feel free to check out my
