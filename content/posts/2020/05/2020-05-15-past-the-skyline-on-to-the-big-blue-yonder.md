  Today is my last day working at Skyline Technologies. In the past
  six-and-a-half years I have built amazing relationships, learned valuable new
  skills, and moved ahead in my career further than I could have imagined.

  of those times.

Today is my last day working at
[Skyline Technologies](https://www.skylinetechnologies.com). In the past
six-and-a-half years I have built amazing relationships, learned valuable new
skills, and moved ahead in my career further than I could have imagined.
However, there are times when you have to make a crazy leap — and this is one of
those times.

On Tuesday, May 26th, I will be starting the next phase in my career as a Senior
Customer Engineer at [Microsoft](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/). I will be
part of the
[FastTrack for Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/programs/azure-fasttrack/)
group, and am excited to have an array of opportunity in front of me.

While I am sad to leave so many amazing people and relationships at Skyline, I
know that I will continue to stay in contact with them. And, of course, I'm
excited to head off to the _Big Blue_ yonder.
