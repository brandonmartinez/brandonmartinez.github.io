I _love_ coffee. It's something that I've almost always been fond of, even as a child. However, in my adult life, I've come to appreciate some of the finer aspects of it: the beans, the preparation, and the drinking style.

My favorite preparation style of coffee is the AeroPress, as [I've mentioned before](https://www.brandonmartinez.com/2012/01/23/the-aeropress/ "The AeroPress"); lately, I've been enjoying espresso with just a dash of cream.

Also, if you're looking for an excellent, mild coffee for espresso, I highly recommend what I used in the video:
