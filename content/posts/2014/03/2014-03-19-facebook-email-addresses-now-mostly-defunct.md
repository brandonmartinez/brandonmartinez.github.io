A few years ago Facebook launched its [anti-email campaign](http://www.fastcompany.com/1702742/facebook-introduces-anti-email-social-inbox-seamless-messaging-conversation-history-video "Fast Company | FACEBOOK INTRODUCES ANTI-EMAIL: SOCIAL INBOX, SEAMLESS MESSAGING, CONVERSATION HISTORY"), saying that the future of messaging is no longer email. As of today (for me at least), they are no longer pushing emails sent to **@facebook.com** addresses into their messaging system.

Either they've achieved their goal of their messaging system being ubiquitous, or they finally decided to give up on the integration.
