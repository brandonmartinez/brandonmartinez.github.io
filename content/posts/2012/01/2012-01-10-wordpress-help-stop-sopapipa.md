This is an excellent write-up from the people at WordPress regarding SOPA/PIPA, and I highly recommend reading the whole thing (it's short).

Here's an excerpt:

> You may have heard people talking/blogging/twittering about SOPA – the Stop Online Piracy Act. The recent SOPA-related boycott of GoDaddy was all over the news, with many people expressing their outrage over the possibilities of SOPA, but when I ask people about SOPA and its sister bill in the Senate, PIPA (Protect IP Act), many don’t really know what the bills propose, or what we stand to lose. If you are not freaked out by SOPA/PIPA, please: for the next four minutes, instead of checking Facebook statuses, seeing who mentioned you on Twitter, or watching the latest episode of Sherlock\*, watch this video (by Fight for the Future).

The next hearing is January 18th; please, **please**, [contact your senators and representatives](https://www.brandonmartinez.com/2011/12/13/if-you-like-using-the-internet/ "If you like using the Internet…") — the future of the Internet counts on it.
