I had planned on writing up my Lightroom workflow at some point, but it looks like someone beat me to it. This is an awesome post that follows a very similar Lightroom workflow to mine. Here are the main steps (the post elaborates on each one):

> 1. Determine a plan of attack
> 2. Download the images
> 3. Eliminating the duds
> 4. Sorting the usable images
> 5. Create a Collection
> 6. Apply initial processing to the images
> 7. Process in the Develop module
> 8. Make one off fixes
> 9. Export and burn

There really are only a few things that I do differently, and I tend to bounce around those steps a lot. However, it's still an excellent post, and very comparable to what I do.
