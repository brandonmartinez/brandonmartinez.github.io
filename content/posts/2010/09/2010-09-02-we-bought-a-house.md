Joy and I purchased our first home!

Apparently I'm not one for writing in chronological order, as I've already written two articles about the move ([here](https://www.brandonmartinez.com/2010/09/01/home-improvement-in-vain-of-stain/ "Home Improvement: In Vain of Stain") and [here](https://www.brandonmartinez.com/2010/09/01/a-charter-communication-mishap/ "A Charter Communication Mishap")), but thought that it needed an official announcement on here. We purchase our first home at the beginning of August, and as of yesterday, are fully moved in (whereby "moved in", I mean all of our stuff is here, not necessarily put in place).

I'm sure I'll be writing more about the new world of homeownership, so stay tuned!

P.S. Yes, [this](https://www.brandonmartinez.com/2010/07/03/tread-lightly/ "Tread Lightly") had something to do with us pursuing owning our own home.
