If you haven't seen on [twitter](https://twitter.com/thatconference) or

[THAT Conference](https://www.thatconference.com/) call for speakers is now open
until April 13th!

[![THAT Conference 2015 - Call for Speakers Now Open!](http://assets.brandonmartinez.com/brandonmartinez/2015/04/20150330-Twitter-Call-for-Speakers-Now-Open.jpg)](https://www.thatconference.com/)

If you're looking for conferences to submit abstracts on anything web, cloud,
mobile, or even soft skill related, this is an amazing Midwest-regional
multi-day conference. It's held at an excellent location (the
[Kalahari in Wisconsin Dells](http://www.kalahariresorts.com/wisconsin)), and
the entire family is invited!

Hope to see you (speaking) there! For more information, visit the
[THAT Conference](https://www.thatconference.com/) website.
