I found this website the other whilst looking for information on the [AeroPress](http://aerobie.com/products/aeropress.htm): [Brew Methods](http://brewmethods.com/).

Essentially, it's a directory of several different brewing methods, pointing to articles, videos, and more. If you love coffee, it's definitely a site to checkout.
