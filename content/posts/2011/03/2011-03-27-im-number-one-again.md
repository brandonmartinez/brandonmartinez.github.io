I've been trying to achieve this for a while: I'm finally number one (again) in a Google search for [my own name](http://www.google.com/search?q=brandon+martinez).

For the last couple of years, the current third result has been number one (not going to say the name here for fear of losing to him again).

Lesson learned: keep site updated with content!
