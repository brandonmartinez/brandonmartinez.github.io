After reading an [excellent tutorial](http://www.tiltshiftphotography.net/) on Tilt-Shift Photography, I decided to give it a try. Keep reading for a full preview of my first attempt.

This picture was taken off the stairwell of our apartment (it's nothing special, obviously); however, the potential for this technique could be great. If I could find someway to get an up-top photo of Ludington's downtown, that could look pretty cool. I'll probably start a new portfolio album once I get a few more of these put together. If you have any suggestions, let me know!
