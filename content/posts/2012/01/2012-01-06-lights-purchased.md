As I mentioned [earlier this week](https://www.brandonmartinez.com/2012/01/03/a-possible-studio-light-setup/ "A Possible Studio LightÂ Setup"), I was looking into getting a home-studio strobe-based lighting setup.

After a lot of great feedback at the [digital photography school forum](http://digital-photography-school.com/forum/other-digital-photography-gear/182016-possible-studio-light-setup-home-portraits.html), I tweaked my original plan:

[![](http://assets.brandonmartinez.com/brandonmartinez/2012/01/paulcbufforder-575x400.png "paulcbufforder")](http://assets.brandonmartinez.com/brandonmartinez/2012/01/paulcbufforder.png)

The main differences are:

- One [B800](http://www.paulcbuff.com/b800.php) _and_ one [B400](http://www.paulcbuff.com/b400.php) (opposed to two [B800](http://www.paulcbuff.com/b800.php)s)
- Two [heavy duty stands](http://www.paulcbuff.com/ls3900.php) instead of the lightweight
- One [51" White PLM](http://www.paulcbuff.com/plm-white.php) and a [51" Soft Silver PLM](http://www.paulcbuff.com/plm-softsilver.php) (instead of the [larger soft silver](http://www.paulcbuff.com/plm-softsilver.php))

My main thought on switching to the B400 + B800 setup is that if I ever want to expand, it'd be easy to throw in another B800 or B1600. It also saved me some money to buy the additional umbrella.

I'll post again once I get them and have had a chance to experiment.
