Yesterday, I had the privilege of being the first guest on the [MS Dev Show](http://www.msdevshow.com "MS Dev Show"). Thank you to Jason and Carl for having me on!

For our discussion, I talked about the benefits of using [JavaScript Promises](https://www.brandonmartinez.com/2014/03/22/grdevday-presentation-recap-from-callback-hell-to-the-javascript-promise-land/ "GRDevDay Presentation Recap: From Callback Hell to the JavaScript “Promise” Land"), as well as the various libraries and standard available to get started using them today.
