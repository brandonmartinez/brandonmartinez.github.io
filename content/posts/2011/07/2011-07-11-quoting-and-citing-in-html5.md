In one of my recent posts, [The Perfect Cup](https://www.brandonmartinez.com/2011/07/05/the-perfect-cup/ "The Perfect Cup"), I made use of HTML5's quoting and citing features to provide "fancy" quotation. An excellent reference for proper use can be found at [HTML5 Doctor](http://html5doctor.com/ "HTML5 Doctor"), along with several other excellent articles:

[Quoting and citing with <blockquote>, <q>, <cite>, and the cite attribute | HTML5 Doctor](http://html5doctor.com/blockquote-q-cite/ "Quoting and citing with
