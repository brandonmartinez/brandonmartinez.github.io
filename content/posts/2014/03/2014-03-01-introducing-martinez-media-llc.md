If you are friends with me on [Facebook](http://facebook.brandonmartinez.com/ "Brandon Martinez on Facebook") or follow me on [twitter](http://twitter.brandonmartinez.com/ "@brandonmartinez on twitter"), you may have seen me mentioning starting a Limited Liability Company (LLC). Well, after a bit of planning, I'm proud to announce that [Martinez Media, LLC](http://www.martinezmedia.net/ "Martinez Media, LLC") is a go!

## What is Martinez Media?

By far, that's the biggest question I've been asked. In fact, I've been asked by people I didn't even realize were interested in this sort of thing!

Martinez Media, LLC is more or less a way for me to umbrella my side ventures. Any side work that I do, including WordPress sites or media design, will be enveloped into this LLC. Also, if you've seen our photography, [Photos by Brandon & Joy](http://www.photosbybrandonandjoy.com/ "Photos by Brandon & Joy"), that's going to be an [assumed name](http://www.michigan.gov/difs/0,5269,7-303-22535_23049-69104--,00.html "Assumed Name on Michigan.gov") for Martinez Media (read:Â _doing business as_).

## So what do you actually do?

The meat-and-potatoes question! As I said, Martinez Media is strictly for my side ventures. Currently, that includes the following:

- WordPress and small website design and setup
- Media design and development (e.g. logo, graphics, typesetting and page layout)
- Social media and SEO setup
- Photography and photo service (e.g. training, consulting, etc)

## Can you do something for me?

Over the next few weeks, I'll be moving my portfolio from this site to the newly created [martinezmedia.net](http://www.martinezmedia.net/ "Martinez Media, LLC"), as well as listing some of these services and prices. Additional contact methods will be listed on there, but for now, feel free to email me: [contact@martinezmedia.net](mailto:contact@martinezmedia.net).

## Don't you already have a job?

Yes, I do. And as far as work goes, that will still be my number one priority. Martinez Media is meant to envelope all the extra stuff I do. Anything that would be better brought to my primary employer will be, and others will fall to Martinez Media. By no means would I be a competitor; that's just silly!

With that said, I do plan on keeping my Martinez Media schedule relatively light. So if you are interested in what I can do for you, [contact me soon](mailto:contact@martinezmedia.net)!
