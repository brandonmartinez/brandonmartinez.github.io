So today I turn 27.

I feel like I've already accomplished a lot in my (relatively) short time
hanging out in the world:
[finished schooling through university](https://www.brandonmartinez.com/2010/12/16/transitioning-from-college-to-the-workforce/),
[got married to a beautiful, loving woman](https://www.brandonmartinez.com/2014/08/09/six-years-of-wedded-bliss/),
[started a family](https://www.brandonmartinez.com/2014/05/29/2014-martinez-baby-its-a/),
[got my career off to a pretty decent start](https://www.brandonmartinez.com/2015/01/10/yesterdays-big-news-promoted/),
bought (two) houses, and the list goes on in no particular order.

However, it's still an interesting feeling… that is, transitioning from my
mid-to-late-twenties. Apparently it's not uncommon to have a
[quarter-life crisis](http://bmtn.us/1BvLWPn "10 Signs You've Hit Your First Life Crisis At The Age Of 27")
around this age; who could blame you given the circumstances a lot of people my
age deal with: finishing school, student loans, starting your career, finding
your place in the world, etc.

But am I nervous about getting to 30 soon? I don't know. Am I going to have a
quarter-life crisis? Probably not. I will say, however, that I can already feel
30 creeping up on me, as I'm no longer the youngest in a lot of groups like the
"good-ol' days" (work, social, or otherwise). I think I'm starting to come to
terms with that scenario, though.

Anyway, I have no specific points or agenda with this post; it's more of a
self-reflection on my current state in life. I'm sure you'll see one of these in
3 years when I do finally hit 30; I'm curious to see where I'm at then.

Here's to another year!
