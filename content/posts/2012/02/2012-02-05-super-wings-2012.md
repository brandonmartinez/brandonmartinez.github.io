As is [becoming tradition](https://www.brandonmartinez.com/2011/02/17/wings/ "Wings!"), I made some of my world-famous chicken wings for Super Bowl XLVI:

There are only two main differences from [last year's](https://www.brandonmartinez.com/2011/02/17/wings/ "Wings!"): I used whole-wings this time (and had to cut them myself), and I made this new pre-bake seasoning:

It's really simple:

- Kosher Salt
- Pepper
- Chili Powder
- Garlic Powder

All to taste, of course. Sprinkle it lightly on the wings before you bake them, and after you flip them to bake the second side. Adds a nice, salty-and-spicy punch to the wing.

Another great year of wings accomplished.
