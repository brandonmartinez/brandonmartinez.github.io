[![New Apple In-Ear Headphones](http://assets.brandonmartinez.com/brandonmartinez/2009/11/IMG_2811-575x383.jpg "New Apple In-Ear Headphones")](http://assets.brandonmartinez.com/brandonmartinez/2009/11/IMG_2811-960x640.jpg)Yesterday at 4:45 PM, I called Apple to get a replacement set of headphones (my right earbud was going in and out). In 10-15 minutes, I had spoken with a service representative, explained my problem, gave my shipping information, and was off the phone. From there, I expected to see my new replacement headphones within a few days. More on the story after the jump. 

This morning, at approximately 10:30 AM, FedEx was knocking on my door; my headphones were already here! I had my old headphones in hand, so I just threw them in the returnable box, ripped off the two part shipping label, and handed it right back to the FedEx delivery guy. Done.

Even better, for some reason Apple decided to give me an upgrade. The headphones above are actually their [higher end model](http://store.apple.com/us/product/MA850G/A "Apple In-Ear Remote Headphones with Mic"). The headphones I was _[supposed](http://store.apple.com/us/product/MB770G/A "Apple Earphones with Remote and Mic")_ [](http://store.apple.com/us/product/MB770G/A "Apple Earphones with Remote and Mic") to receive are the ones pictured below. Now, if that isn't customer service, I don't know what is!![Apple Headphones with Remote and Mic](http://assets.brandonmartinez.com/brandonmartinez/2009/11/MB770.jpeg "Apple Headphones with Remote and Mic")
