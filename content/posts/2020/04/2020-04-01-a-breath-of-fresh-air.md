My [last post](/2018/10/15/where-have-i-been) on this site was about how I
haven't posted in a while… and that was nearly two years ago! I seriously have
not been great about keeping this site updated, and I talk about it regularly on
here.

As such, I'm happy to announce that I'm rethinking this site. Instead of it
being "just a blog", I want this to be a landing page for anything in my public
life.

For example, I often get asked about the gear I use for my day job, side jobs,
or my hobbies. That often means I need to gather a bunch of links, explain what
I like about that gear, and send that off to whomever is asking. That is really
tedious, especially if I've had to put that same list together in the past!

Instead, I can create a page on this site under the new "gear" section of the
home page with all that information.

In addition to repurposing the site, I've also used this as an opportunity to
learn a new tech stack and to refine some of my React skills. I've moved the
site off of WordPress, and it's now being generated with
[next.js](https://nextjs.org/). The site should be noticeably faster, as I'm
taking advantage of next.js's ability to render a statically generated site, as
well as being cheaper to maintain (it's literally just HTML, JS, and CSS sitting
some cloud storage).

I'm hoping the desire to pursue the tech also forces my hand a bit to keep this
a bit more… fresh.

Thanks for coming along this ride with me; looking forward to generating more
usable content for all of us! And please don't just my old posts too harshly;
I'm still trying to clean up some of the old content to fit this new site setup.

And no, this isn't an April Fool's joke!
