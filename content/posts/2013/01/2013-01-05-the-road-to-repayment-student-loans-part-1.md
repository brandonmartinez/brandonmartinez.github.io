Today I accomplished a very big thing: I paid off _one_ of my student loans.

Joy and I have a lot of life goals as a family, and we want to try and accomplish them in as proper of an order as we can. Part of that is reducing our overall debt, especially debt in student loans.

Today I paid off approximately 25% of my student loan debt.

We are very lucky, and very thankful, that we're able to do this. It took a long time to save that much, but in the end it's saving us a lot in interest.

I can only hope we can stay on and finish this road of repayment.
