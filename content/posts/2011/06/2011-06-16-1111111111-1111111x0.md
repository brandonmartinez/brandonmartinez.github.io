I keep seeing this on Facebook, and for whatever reason, everyone is getting a different answer. Let's take a look at this problem, and figure out the correct answer.

If you remember back to elementary school, there was this thing called [the order of operations (OoO)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_of_operations "Order of Operations on Wikipedia"). For the sake of this problem, we only need to know a very small portion of the OoO:

1. Multiplication comes first
2. Addition and subtraction come second
3. Operations are performed by level from left-to-right, starting with the highest level first (so, left-to-right with multiplication, then left-to-right with addition/subtraction)

Let's walk through those three steps.

## Multiplication

Since there are no parentheses, the multiplication that happens in this equation **only applies to the preceding number**. So, to make this simple, let's stub-in parentheses where they would go if we wanted to be verbose:

(1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1-1+1+1+1+1+1)+(1x0)

**It is not this:**

(1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1-1+1+1+1+1+1+1)x0

The end result becomes:

(1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1-1+1+1+1+1+1)+(0)

## Addition/Subtraction

Now that multiplication is out of the way, we can perform addition and subtraction. Something to keep in mind, unless there are parentheses, addition and subtraction **have the same weight**. By that, I mean you start from the left, go right, and perform them in the order you encounter. To make this simpler, let's convert that pesky subtraction into an addition:

(1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+(-1)+1+1+1+1+1)+(0)

All that's left is to add them all together:

(1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+(-1)+1+1+1+1+1)+(0) = **14**

## Double-Check

If you want to double-check, you can always check with one of the smartest math-engines out there: [WolframAlpha](http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=1%2B1%2B1%2B1%2B1%2B1%2B1%2B1%2B1%2B1-1%2B1%2B1%2B1%2B1%2B1%2B1x0 "1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1-1+1+1+1+1+1+1x0 on WolframAlpha"). According to him, it looks like we did this right!

## Moral of the Story

Anytime you get a "tricky" math problem, just remember your order of operations and you'll be fine.
