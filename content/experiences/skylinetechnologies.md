As not just a software engineer, but also as a consultant, I work with clients
across various industries to help develop systems to better their day-to-day
processes and products. Some of those industries include manufacturing and
print, finance, healthcare and insurance, among others.

I specialize in web-based solutions, including both on-premise and cloud
(mostly Azure but some AWS and GCP as well), using a wide range of technology
stacks such as Microsoft's .NET Core and node.js platforms.

In addition to development, I also help architect and design how these systems
will function both internally and integrating with external systems (often
against legacy-style services).
