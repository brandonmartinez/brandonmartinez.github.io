For those of you that didn't see the news, I put together a (quick) website for
the upcoming addition to our family:
[Seth Martinez](http://www.sethmartinez.com/). Well, apparently the spammers of
the world have already picked that up. I just received an email from the Devan H
Crow company regarding the site. An excerpt:

> Good afternoon, I'm Devan. I just visited sethmartinez.com. Is this your
> website?
>
> I am contacting you because I work with independent website owners and I would
> like to offer my service and experience to you.

> I have been a website designer, developer, programmer, graphic designer,
> business consultant, an internet marketer with over 15 years of experience
> (since 1995).
>
> I own and personally operate a private web hosting company (providing shared,
> dedicated, and cloud options on Windows and Linux servers), an autoresponder
> service (allowing for unlimited subscribers without monthly fees), and an
> email address verification service that has proven to increase delivery rates
> of autoresponders, newsletters, and traditional email marketing.

That's pretty defensive spam!

Also, this is another reason I (and apparently other people) think it may be
spam:

And if it's not, well, as a friend of mine put _"This might not be a spambot! It
might be a real-life jackass :P"_.

And speaking of the subject of these emails, if you want some good hosting, use
this promo code from Dreamhost and have your first year at \$3.95/mo:
