A very quick Lightroom tip: you can assign the + and \- keys to any of the Lightroom develop settings. To do so, just click on the name of the setting:

You can then use the + or \- keys to adjust that setting. Useful if you've applied a preset to a batch of photos and you just need to adjust something simple like exposure.
