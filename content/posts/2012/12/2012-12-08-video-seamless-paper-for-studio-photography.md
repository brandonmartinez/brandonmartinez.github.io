Always looking to improve our photography skills, we've been looking in how to get studio-quality backgrounds for portraits. Somewhat [related to my recent post](https://www.brandonmartinez.com/2012/11/24/photography-tip-use-wrapping-paper-for-backdrops/ "Photography Tip: Use Wrapping Paper forÂ Backdrops"), paper appears to be the way to go.

This Adorama TV video gives an **excellent** overview on using seamless paper; I highly recommend watching the entire video:

[Seamless paper](http://www.savagepaper.com/index.php?option=com_content&view=category&layout=blog&id=2&Itemid=4 "Seamless Background Paper - Savage Photography Products") looks like an awesome approach, but I'll have to wait until we can revamp our [current background setup](https://www.brandonmartinez.com/camera-gear/#ravellistand "My Camera Gear - brandonmartinez").
