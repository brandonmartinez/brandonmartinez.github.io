With the heat waves that have been hitting West Michigan, it's essential to find ways to stay cool. While hanging out in the air conditioning is nice, it's even better if you can find a cool treat to relax with.

I had some leftover watermelon and cantaloupe (we've gone through a half-dozen or more this season), so I thought I'd try making a sorbet for the first time:

Overall, it wasn't too difficult:

### Ingredients

- Approximately six cups of chopped melon: watermelon, cantaloupe, honeydew, or a mixture
- One cup of sugar
- One tablespoon of lemon juice

### Steps

1. Mix all of the ingredients together in a blender
2. Blend until smooth
3. Pour into a metal bowl and cover with a layer of plastic wrap laying on the surface of the mixture
4. Freeze for approximately 3 hours
5. Remove from freezer; the mixture should have formed a frozen "crust". Mix again until semi-smooth
6. Recover and freeze for an additional 3 - 4 hours
7. Done!

Being the first time I've made sorbet, I was rather impressed with the results. The texture turned out to be between a normal sorbet and a shaved ice; I'll need to research on how to make it a bit smoother. The melon flavor was perfect; it was a very light, but still sweet, flavor.

As I said, overall I'm impressed. A simple recipe with a great result. I'll definitely be making this again!
