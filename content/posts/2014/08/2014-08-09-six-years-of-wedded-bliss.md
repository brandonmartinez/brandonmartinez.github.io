It's hard to believe that six years have passed since I married my wife. I still remember when she walked down the aisle, as beautiful as I had ever seen her:

We've come a long way together in these six short years: moving away to college, living out of state for a summer, moving back home to Ludington, buying two houses, giving birth to one of the most beautiful (and smart) little boys we know, with another on the way. I can't imagine doing any of these without her.

So to that, happy anniversary, Joy. I love you and the life you've helped make with me more and more every day. Here's to many more years together.
