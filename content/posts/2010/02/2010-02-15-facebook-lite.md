\[update\]Alright, it looks like Facebook removed this feature… why, Facebook?\[/update\]

For all of you that despise the new Facebook layout, there is an alternative: Facebook Lite.

From what I can tell, here's everything that's been changed:

- Sidebar Navigation: has been removed.
- Search and Top Navigation: has been changed to reflect older Facebook revisions; if my memory serves me correctly, this is very close to how Facebook originally
- News Feed: very twitter-like, only shows status updates and a few applications (photos, events, and notes from what I can tell).

Check it out here: [Facebook Lite](http://lite.facebook.com/). If you'd like, you can even make it your [default Facebook experience](http://lite.facebook.com/settings/defaultsite/).
