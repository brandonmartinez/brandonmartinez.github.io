One of my favorite areas of photography is product-shots. It takes a special skill to be able to highlight the important aspects of a product in one photo, and further more, to persuade someone to buy that item.

Recently, I was asked to shoot a small set of products for a friend (jewelry, specifically). However, I didn't have an ideal setup for photographing _flat_ products. I couldn't use the usual [light tent](http://digital-photography-school.com/how-to-make-a-inexpensive-light-tent "How to Make An Inexpensive Light Tent — DIY"), but I still had to take the photos on a white background. Luckily, I was able to engineer something together.

Here's the basis of the setup I came up with:

- A [multi-disc reflector](https://www.brandonmartinez.com/camera-gear/#5in1reflector "43â€³ 5-in-1 Collapsible Multi-Disc Light Reflector") setup as the "light table" for the product atop of household-product-supports.
- [B400 strobe](https://www.brandonmartinez.com/camera-gear/#alienbeesb400 "AlienBees B400 Strobe") underneath the reflector; I don't have a ground-level tripod, so I just tucked it neatly into a box.
- [B800 strobe](https://www.brandonmartinez.com/camera-gear/#alienbeesb800 "AlienBees B800 Strobe") on light-stand with [PLM umbrella](https://www.brandonmartinez.com/camera-gear/#whiteplm "White PLM Umbrella") for the overhead key light.
- [Canon 7D](https://www.brandonmartinez.com/camera-gear/#canon7d "Canon 7D") on the [Manfrotto tripod](https://www.brandonmartinez.com/camera-gear/#manfrottotripod "Manfrotto Tripod"), balancing across three various shelving units.
- Tethered MacBook for previewing and on-the-spot editing of the shots
- And of course, whatever product I'm going to photograph, placed on the multi-disc.

And photos of the setup:

As an added bit of insurance that the tripod didn't tip forward, I decided to tie some 30lb fishing line to the back leg:

The final shot turned out decently:

Overall, I was pretty impressed with the near-studio-quality photos out of such a thrown-together setup. Granted, I am using strobes and a decent camera, but it was being able to put them together in a creative way that made the photos turn out as great as they did. I'll update this post with a link to the real shoot as soon as they're able to go public.
