A volunteer member of the Worship Team as a multi-instrumentalist and
occasional vocalist, I have served in both member and leadership
capacities on the team. As interim band-director, I was able to improve team
communication and management, while also helping the lead pastor organize
and maintain a growing repertoire of songs and missional objectives.

In addition to serving in a musical capacity, I've also helped expand and
pioneer the areas of audio and sound production with automated lyrical
projection, multitrack playback, and other interconnected technologies to
help achieve continued outreach goals.
