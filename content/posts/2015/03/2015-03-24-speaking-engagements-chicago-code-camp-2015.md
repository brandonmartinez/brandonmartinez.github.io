Chicago, are you ready for some sass? I'll be speaking at Chicago Code Camp on
April 18, 2015!

I'll be giving my relatively new presentation on SASS:
[Make a SASSy CSS Cocktail: Bourbon and Bitters Served Neat](http://www.chicagocodecamp.com/Sessions/SessionDetail/13).

More information can be found at the
[Chicago Code Camp](http://www.chicagocodecamp.com/) site.
