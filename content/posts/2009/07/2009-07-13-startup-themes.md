Brad, Bill, Joy, and I were in Appleton, Wisconsin over the weekend, and stopped by Guitar Center to see what was going down (I haven't been to any music shops since we were in Michigan; it's been killing me!). Brad and Bill ended up over by the keyboard section (Bill was making some excellent jams), so I wandered over to see what was up. There was a keyboard next to them, and it was set up with this exact sound. Video after the jump.

After doing some research, this actually isn't the Windows 95 startup theme. Brad's first guess was one of the old Mac startup themes, so it may be that. If anyone knows/remembers, leave a comment. Thanks!
