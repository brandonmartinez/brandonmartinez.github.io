For Christmas, Joy bought me a Wii. Being one of the best gifts you can get this year, I was excited to start building a game collection and finding other additional things to go along with it. I ordered my copy of [New Super Mario Bros.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Super_Mario_Bros._Wii) (which I'm expecting in the mail by Monday), an additional [off-brand Wiimote](http://www.walmart.com/catalog/product.do?product_id=10997397), and a [neat charging station with rechargeable batteries](http://www.walmart.com/Intec-Wii-Battery-Charging-Station/ip/7789021) for the Wiimote. It was all working great, except that the off-brand Wiimote didn't fit in the charging station properly!

I decided to take the Nyko Wiimote back and replace it with an Official Nintendo model. After I made the return, I went to grab a Wiimote. **Completely. Sold. Out.** Across all of Big Rapids. Even more so, across this entire part of the state (I check on Walmart.com for a 100mi radius)! Now what?

Obviously, I could order one online and wait a few weeks for it to be delivered. By then, however, the stores would probably have them in stock.

After searching for other alternatives, I found the Walmart in Ludington had the [black Wiimote with MotionPlus](http://www.walmart.com/catalog/product.do?product_id=13020907 "Black Wii Remote and Wii MotionPlus Bundle at Walmart.com"). After talking it over with Joy, I made the decision to buy one. I went to Walmart to pick it up, and guess what? Sold out! This was getting far beyond ridiculous.

Since I was left without an additional Wiimote for who-knows-how-long, I switched from my main quest to a filler: I looked at the available games to see if I could catch a sale. As I was browsing through the game section, my eye caught something on the very bottom shelf. Two copies of [Wii Play](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wii_Play "Wii Play on Wikipedia").

If you notice from the above image, _Wii Play_ comes with a bonus Wiimote. Jackpot! For and additional $20, I could have the Wiimote _and_ 9 additional Mii-based mini-games. Taking into consideration I would have to wait for an unknown amount of time to get an additional Wiimote, this was a steal. I quickly bought a copy and called it a day.

**Moral of the Story:** Make sure you check all of your avenues when looking for gaming peripherals. If you need a Wiimote, _Wii Play_ is an awesome deal and the answer to your search.

_An additional note: When I was purchasing Wii Play, the associate at Walmart actually told me people were buying this game **only** for the fact that it had the Wiimote included. I guess I'm not the first to discover this neat tip._
