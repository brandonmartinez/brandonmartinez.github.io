If you had the opportunity to attend my presentation at the
[2015 GRDevDay](http://grdevday.org/) or the
[2015 Chicago Code Camp](http://www.chicagocodecamp.com/), thank you for coming
out to see me. You'll find the abstract, presentation, and additional resources
in this post.

## Abstract

With the popularity of CSS frameworks and preprocessors, there are many options
available for web developers in modularizing their styles. But once we've gotten
past some of the "do-it-all" frameworks like Twitter's Bootstrap, how can we
maintain more control but still ease our development?

Simple! Three small SASS libraries: Bourbon, Neat, and Bitters. Using these
three libraries, we can easily build and maintain a site's user interface,
including taking advantage of newer CSS3 features such as transitions,
transforms, and responsive design. In this session, we'll setup a SASS
environment and get to work building a UI that you can easily maintain even
after a few drinks.
