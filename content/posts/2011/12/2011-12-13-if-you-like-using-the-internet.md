Then please, **please**, help stop [SOPA (Stop Online Piracy Act)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stop_Online_Piracy_Act "Stop Online Piracy Act on Wikipedia") from passing.

It's easy to do:

1. Go to the [Stop American Censorship](http://americancensorship.org/ "Stop American Censorship") website for information
2. **[Fill out this form](http://americancensorship.org/posts/1/uncensor#general "To uncensor, write Congress now")**
3. There is no step 3… really, that's all you have to do.

This will help make sure that websites such as Facebook, Youtube, Wikipedia, Twitter, personal websites, among thousands of others, will remain uncensored on the Internet.

Here's more info on SOPA from the [Stop American Censorship](http://americancensorship.org/infographic.html) website:
