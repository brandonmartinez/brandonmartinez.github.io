Well, our family
[made the paper](http://www.shorelinemedia.net/ludington_daily_news/news/local/fountain-man-arrested-with-binoculars-admits-to-peeping-in-ludington/article_a6d53724-db33-11e5-9307-4b414ef46b18.html);
though, not necessarily for reasons that we like.

An excerpt from the Ludington Daily News:

> Homeowner Brandon Martinez posted video and still images on his Facebook page
> Tuesday, showing the man was outside his Elder Lane home at 7:09 a.m. that
> day. He contacted police about the incident later in the day.
>
> Ludington Police officers were checking the area regularly throughout the
> night, then at 7:10 a.m. Wednesday, almost exactly 24 hours after he was seen
> on video at the Elder Lane home, Wells found a man matching the description of
> the man on the video walking on Sherman Street.
>
> After a brief discussion, Wells was able to confiscate a pair of binoculars
> and obtain a confession to a series of window peeping incidents over the last
> several months, Ludington Police Chief Mark Barnett said.

Not quite the excitement that I was looking for this week, but I'm glad we were
able to put our home security system to some good use.
