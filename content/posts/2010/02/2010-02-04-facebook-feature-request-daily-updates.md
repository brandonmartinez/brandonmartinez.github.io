As far as social networking goes, Facebook is one the best out there. It has a huge feature set, can be extended by apps, and almost everyone I know has one. However, that doesn't mean there aren't areas for improvement.

I honestly hate getting emails _every_ time something occurs. Someone tagged me in a post or a photo, someone wants me to join Farmville or Mafia Wars, they think I'm a family member, etc, etc, and etc! I have over 5000 Facebook notifications in my Gmail (yeah, I don't delete anything). It gets a little overwhelming.

Facebook, how about an option to subscribe to daily, weekly, or even monthly updates, instead of alerting me 500 times a day? Please?

Does anyone out there agree?
