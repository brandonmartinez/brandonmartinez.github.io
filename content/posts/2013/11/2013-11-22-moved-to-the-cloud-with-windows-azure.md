While I do realize that "the cloud" is really just a buzzword for "hosted on the internet", I'm still proud to announce that my personal WordPress sites are now all hosted on [Windows Azure](http://www.windowsazure.com/ "Windows Azure").

I've been really impressed with the overall simplicity of getting a WordPress multisite up-and-running, as well as how the performance has been compared to my [last host](http://www.dreamhost.com/ "Dreamhost"). As an added bonus (if I calculated correctly), I'll be saving $5 a month in hosting fees by using Azure (Windows Azure Web Sites, Blob Storage, and ClearDb).

If you're currently running a WordPress site on a shared host, I'd highly recommend looking into Azure. Besides a decent price and good performance, their git-based deployment setup is stellar. Seriously, check it out!
