The reason I bought a WD My Book Live is because of a recommendation from [Jim Cloudman](http://www.jimcloudman.com/ "Jim Cloudman"), who posts an excellent tip to enable SSH access on the device.

> I found out a little while ago, though, that it has hidden SSH access, and inside is a Debian installation, with 256MB of RAM and an 800MHz processor.

To enable SSH access, just go to **http://{NAS Address}.local/UI/ssh** and enable SSH access:

From there, the Linux OS is available for your tweaking. Thanks, Jim!
