After reading the [article on Lifehacker](http://lifehacker.com/5395933/brush-your-iphones-bezel-to-hide-scuffs-and-scratches "Brush Your iPhone's Bezel to Hide Scuffs and Scratches") about giving your iPhone a "brushed metal" makeover, I decided to try it myself. Now, I had previously done this same technique back when I had an [iPod Photo](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPod_Photo "iPod Photo: Wikipedia"), and it worked quite well (especially since I bought it off a friend, so it already had some wear to begin with). After getting some materials together, I was ready to start my brushing adventure!

First, tape off the plastic backing to avoid additional and unwanted scratches (it's kind of hard to see the tape in the photo).

It may take some time to get the look you want, but when you're done, it's well worth it!
