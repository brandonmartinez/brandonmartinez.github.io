It's seldom that I "repost" anything, but this video is too amazing to not share:

[4 things we'd LOVE to see in the next iOS](http://vimeo.com/23998290) from [Color Monkey](http://vimeo.com/colormonkey) on [Vimeo](http://vimeo.com).

I think the execution and production of the video is excellent, but I think even more outstanding is how well they were able to make these features look very "Apple-like" and feel like they were native to iOS. Impressive.
