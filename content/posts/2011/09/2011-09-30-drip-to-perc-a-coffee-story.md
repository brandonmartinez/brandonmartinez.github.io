Just over a month ago, my [drip coffee maker](http://www.amazon.com/Ge-12-cup-Digital-Coffee-Maker/dp/B001J15TVY/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&qid=1317360704&sr=8-3 "Ge 12-cup Digital Coffee Maker") started to malfunction; it was burning any coffee that it made. With two avid coffee drinkers in the house, we needed to find a replacementâ€¦ and fast!

I researched into many different types of coffee makers: higher-end drip makers (including the [Keurig](http://www.keurig.com/ "Keurig")), several french presses, [the aeropress](http://aerobie.com/products/aeropress.htm), and a few percolators. There were several options to choose from, but after reading the various reviews and experiences, I decided to purchase a percolator: the [Farberware Stainless Steel Percolator](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005NCWQ "Farberware 50124 Classic Yosemite Stainless Steel Percolator on Amazon.com").

The percolator was very affordable, the reviews seemed to show it was a good product, and I wanted to try something new and different. I went from this:

To this:

Even though it looks old-fashioned, making coffee on the stove and all, but this percolator produces some of the best coffee I've ever had. After spending more than a month with it, I can say that I am fully satisfied with my purchase. And not only is the coffee good, the experience is nice, too; waking up every morning, putting coffee on the stove, listening to the bubbles and smelling the scent of freshly brewed coffee, how can you beat that?

The only downfall, in my opinion, is that this is not a "set it and forget it" kind of deal; you need to pay attention to it, or you may end up burning your house down. However, I feel that the quality of the coffee produced is definitely worth that trade-off, and if you have 10 or 15 minutes in the morning, it's not that big of a deal.

If you're in the market for a new coffee maker, you want to have some of the best coffee in your life, and you have a few minutes to spare in the morning, I would definitely recommend buying [one of these](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005NCWQ "Farberware 50124 Classic Yosemite Stainless Steel Percolator on Amazon.com").

_P.S. based on the recommendations of various buyers on Amazon, I decided to purchase a different top for my percolator: [a clear glass percolator top](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0007Y8MDG "Clear glass percolator top, fits Farberware, etc. on Amazon.com"). Originally, it comes with a plastic one that has been known to melt; this glass one works perfectly with the percolator I purchased._
