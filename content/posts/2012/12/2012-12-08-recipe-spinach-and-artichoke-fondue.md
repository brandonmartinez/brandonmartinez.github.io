## Ingredients

- 2 cups chicken broth
- 9 oz. (1 pkg) frozen spinach, chopped
- 6 oz. jarred and marinated artichoke hearts, chopped
- 2 tbsp. chopped/minced garlic
- 2 green onions
- 8 oz. Cream Cheese, room temperature
- 1/2 cup buttermilk
- 1 tbsp sour cream
- 2 cups shredded cheese (I used 1/2 cup of Asiago, 1/2 cup of Italian blend, 1 cup of Velveeta® Queso Blanco)
- 1 tsp. grated Parmesan cheese
- a small amount of flour

## Directions

1. Mix the cream cheese, buttermilk, and sour cream together in a mixing bowl until slightly chunky consistency. Add in 1/2 cup of shredded cheese (I used the Asiago for this step). Lightly flour and stir (helps the cheese blend with the broth). Set aside.
2. In a medium-sized sauce pot, bring the chicken broth to just under a boil.
3. Mix in garlic, green onions, spinach, and artichokes into the broth. Stir until just under a boil. Bring temperature to medium-high.
4. Slowly add-in the cream cheese mixture, letting mix fully before adding more. Continue until you've used all of the mixture.
5. Add in more cheese as needed to thicken the fondue. Once to desired consistency, transfer to a fondue pot to serve along with pita slices and bread cubes.

This is one of the best spinach and artichoke recipes I've had; enjoy!
