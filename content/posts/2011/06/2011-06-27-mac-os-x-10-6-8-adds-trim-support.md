Apparently, the recent Mac OS X update added TRIM support (at least for stock Apple SSDs in older machines). Very nice and about time!

\[update\]Apparently, it **only** works for Apple's stock-SSDs. I have an [80 GB Intel X25-M](http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16820167031&cm_re=Intel_X25_80_GB-_-20-167-031-_-Product) in Joy's laptop and it did **not** get TRIM support.\[/update\]
