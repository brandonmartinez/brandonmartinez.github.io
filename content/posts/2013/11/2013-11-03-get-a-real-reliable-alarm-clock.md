Happy end-of-Daylight Saving Time, everybody! I don't know about you, but I woke up at the proper time today. I like to think it's because of my excellent sense of time, but in reality it's probably because I use _a real, reliable alarm clock_ for all of my waking-up business.

I see a lot of these statuses around any time changes:

For as big of a techno-geek as I am, there's one piece of functionality I shy-away from using on my personal devices: the alarm clock. With the number of [DST bugs](http://bmtn.us/1al4Nxs "Apple Insider | Another daylight saving time bug strikes Apple's iOS 7, affects calendar display") [that have](http://bmtn.us/17FMrL2 "Neowin | Motorola warns of DST bug on their devices running Android 2.3") [appeared recently](http://bmtn.us/1al4W3T "Android Central | Daylight Savings time bug on Samsung Epic"), I have a hard time trusting my phone as a reliable alarm clock.

If you care about waking up properly, I encourage you to get yourself a real, reliable alarm clock. Personally, I recommend the [Sony ICFC414 Clock Radio](http://bmtn.us/1al59nP "Sony ICFC414 Clock Radio on Amazon") (it even auto-adjusts for DST):

P.S. no offense to those I used as examples; I blocked your identities :)
