After picking up a license of [Camtasia for Mac](http://www.techsmith.com/camtasia-mac-features.html "Camtasia for Mac | TechSmith") while at [THAT Conference](https://www.thatconference.com/ "THAT Conference | Summer Camp for Geeks"), I thought it would be awesome to put it to use by recording a post-processing session.

Here is the entire session, a senior photo shoot, sped-up 600% for your quick-viewing pleasure. I recommend making it fullscreen to see the proper level of detail.

I would love to hear feedback from any other photographers out there: questions, comments, critiques, and so on. You can view the entire completed album on [our photography site](http://bmtn.us/1lyUkeE "20140806 - Ingrid's Senior Photos | Martinez Media Photography").
