A while back, a friend of mine showed me a technique for preparing watermelon that I've come to call "scalping" a watermelon. It gets rid of all the rind, and makes it easy to cut servable pieces. Check out the video for a demonstration:

1. **Cut Off Both Ends:** create a spot to set the watermelon on and a starting point for trimming.
2. **Shave Off Rind:** this is where the real work is; start chopping away large chunks of the rind. Be careful not to remove too much, though.
3. **Remove Leftover Rind:** I chose to do this using a combination of a knife and a vegetable peeler, but you could stick to just the knife if you wanted. Remove as much of the leftover, white rind as possible.
4. **Flip and Trim:** flip the watermelon over to get any remaining, hard-to-reach rind that is left.
5. **Cut For Serving:** cut and slice into easy-to-eat pieces. Enjoy!

I really like this technique, and the speed is nice as well:
