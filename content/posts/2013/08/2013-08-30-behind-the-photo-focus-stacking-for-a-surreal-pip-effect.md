A couple of days ago, Joy and I [had a photoshoot](http://www.photosbybrandonandjoy.com/People/Corey-and-Ashlee/20130828-Engagement-Photos) with our good friends Corey and Ashlee. We went to the Ludington State Park and had an excellent session; they were an excellent couple to work with and everyone had a great time. And while I usually don't post our shoots on my site, I wanted to give a quick overview of a particular (awesome) photo from our session with them.

Here's a high-level overview of how that photo was made (click for a larger view):

[![How the photo was made: proper setup with the post-editing process in mind made this photo a win.](http://assets.brandonmartinez.com/brandonmartinez/2013/08/20130828-makingaphoto-1200x543.jpg)](http://assets.brandonmartinez.com/brandonmartinez/2013/08/20130828-makingaphoto.jpg)

A few things we did to make this happen:

- Knowing that our depth-of-field was going to be relatively shallow, we knew that we had to focus stack.
- We started off by focusing on our subjects; we wanted them to get comfortable and make _the_ pose happen naturally.
- Getting the frame photo shortly after we got _the_ pose helped ensure that in post-processing our vision had a template to follow.
- In post, it was just a matter of putting the two photos in layers, adding a couple of layer masks, and cloning away the tree that ran through the frame.

Overall, I'm really happy with this photo. Not only is it a good picture in-and-of itself, the effect draws interest to the "how" of the photo.

## Update

So I just realized my "In-Focus Subjects" inset photo is actually the same one as the finished photo. Apparently I imported the wrong image when making the composite. Here is the actual "In-Focus Subjects":
