This is the first time I've ever gone to a midnight-showing. I think I saved this experience for a (hopefully) good movie: Harry Potter 7, Part Two.

We waited in line for an hour (and we already had tickets) just to get into the auditorium:

Now I'm just waiting for the screen to light up:

Hope this movie is worth it!
