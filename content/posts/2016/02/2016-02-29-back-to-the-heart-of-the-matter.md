As I get back into the swing of things, I just wanted to say this: Joy and I are
extremely blessed to have so many amazing people in our lives.

Last week was quite the scare, but so many people were there to help us whenever
and wherever we needed it. The support, prayers, thoughts, well-wishes, and just
general concern from all of our friends and family was well felt and it made our
dealing with an intense situation so much easier.

I would love to personally thank all of you individually, but seriously, I don't
think I could count the number of people that jumped to our aide.

Thanks again, everyone. You are appreciated beyond all measure!

Here's to a normal week!
