Lead and participated in the development of automation systems, reporting
frameworks, integration services, and other infrastructure to improve
company efficiency in its print and production processes.

This was my first full-time remote job during my career. I started as an
on-site intern the summer of 2009 as a software developer, quickly becoming
part time during my senior year at FSU as a remote employee. Upon graduation,
became a full-time remote employee quickly moving from software developer to
lead software developer of the Information Systems department.
