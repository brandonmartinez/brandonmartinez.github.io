If you use a Mac, there are tons of text navigation tools at your disposal. One of the little known is navigating text by word:

- Move your cursor between words: **alt + Left or Right Arrow Key**. This lets you jump between words in a sentence. This is helpful when you find that you mistyped a word earlier in a sentence, and you don't want to use your mouse to move your cursor to the right spot.
- Move your cursor between paragraphs: **alt + Up or Down Arrow Key**. This lets you jump to the beginnings and ends of paragraphs, and is very useful when navigating large amounts of text.
- Delete the previous word: **alt+delete**. If you want to delete the last word you typed, this combination is handy.
- Delete the next word: **alt+forward delete (fn+delete on laptops)**. Similar to the previous tip, this deletes the word in front of your cursor.

Do you have any other text navigation tips?

**Update:** Added the paragraph navigation tip.
