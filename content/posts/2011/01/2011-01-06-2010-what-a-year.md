2010: a lot of things happened.

Alright, that was a cheap intro. Seriously though, here are some of the major occurrences:

- [Graduated from Ferris State University](/2010/05/12/1342422/ "1+3+4+2+4+2+2")
- [Started my full-time job](/2010/06/19/full-time/ "Full-Time!")
- [Bought a house](/2010/09/01/we-bought-a-house/ "We Bought a House!")
- [Found out we're having a baby](http://twitter.com/brandonmartinez/status/7971359485329408 "Twitter Status: We're Having a Baby!")
- [Got promoted to lead software developer @ IPC](/2010/12/19/moving-on-up/ "Moving On Up")

All-in-all, I have to say it was quite a good year. I can't wait to see what 2011 has in store.
