A few weeks ago, I picked up a new guitar: the [Ibanez ART300](http://ibanez.wikia.com/wiki/ART300).

So far, I've loved everything about it: it has a nice weight, the neck plays very smoothly, the body cut-away allows for easy soloing, the knobs and controls work very smoothly, and overall is an amazing guitar to play.

My favorite thing, however, is that I can play just about any genre and get a great sound out of it. Here's [a clean lil' something](http://soundcloud.com/brandondmartinez/ze-new-guitar):

  

And here's with [the distortion turned up a bit](http://soundcloud.com/brandondmartinez/song-001):

  

So far, I'm loving the sound I'm getting out of it. I hope to record some more music; if you're interested, follow me on [SoundCloud](http://soundcloud.com/brandondmartinez/ "Brandon Martinez on SoundCloud").
