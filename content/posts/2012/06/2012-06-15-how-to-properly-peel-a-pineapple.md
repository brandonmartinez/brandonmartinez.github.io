Today I finally cut up a pineapple that had been sitting atop my fridge for the last three days.

"So what," you say; "it's just a pineapple," you say? Well, the reason this is exciting is that I learned the _proper_ way to peel and cut a pineapple in the process. Thanks to this video that I found via a Google search, I'm on my way to become a pro-pineapple peeler:

And now, presenting my first attempt at this method:

Not too bad; obviously I can work on my technique, but that takes practice.

As far as actually _eating_ the fruit, it was just a matter of quartering it and chopping it into bite-sized pieces once it had been peeled.

And now you know the proper way to peel a pineapple; give it a try!
