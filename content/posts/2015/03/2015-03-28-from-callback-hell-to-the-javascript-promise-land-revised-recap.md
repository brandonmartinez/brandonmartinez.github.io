If you had the opportunity to attend my presentation at the
[2015 NEWCodeCamp](http://www.newcodecamp.com/), thank you for coming out to see
me. You'll find the abstract, presentation, and additional resources in this
post.

## Abstract

We’ve all been there: buried 15 layers deep in JavaScript functions wondering
where in the Callback Hell we are. How did we get here? Handling asynchronous
code forces us to build an unmanageable stack of function calls, often leaving
us buried beneath them. Is there a better way to handle this? Luckily, there is;
I promise.

JavaScript promises give us an elegant way to handle asynchronous code. Through
the power of its “then” method, we’re able to chain, instead of stack, our logic
together.
