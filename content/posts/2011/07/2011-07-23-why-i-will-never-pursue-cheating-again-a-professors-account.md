This account of a university professor's battle with cheating was an interesting read. He goes on to tell of how he used the university's anti-cheating measures, as well as his own tactics, but in the end received the opposite of what he was hoping for: poor professor-evaluations from students resulting in a lower raise in his salary.

If you're an educator, or have any interest in the school systems, you need to read this: [Why I Will Never Pursue Cheating Again](http://behind-the-enemy-lines.blogspot.com/2011/07/why-i-will-never-pursue-cheating-again.html).
