This is an excellent article from the makers of [Tower](http://www.git-tower.com/ "Tower")\[ref\]Tower is an excellent app for managing git repositories; a bit pricey, but there is a 30-day free trial. [Check it out](http://www.git-tower.com/ "Tower").\[/ref\]. It's written assuming you're using [git](http://git-scm.com/ "git"), but there are a lot of great points if you're using **any** source code management solution:

1. Commit Related Changes
2. Commit Often
3. Donâ€™t Commit Half-Done Work
4. Test Before You Commit
5. Write Good Commit Messages
6. Version Control is not a Backup System
7. Use Branches
8. Agree on a Workflow

Be sure to [read the original article](http://blog.fournova.com/2011/06/version-control-best-practices/ "Version Control Best Practices | fournova blog") to see an explanation of each point.
