If you are receiving this error from iTunes when trying to authorize and play an Audible book, **Could not authorize this computer because either your user name or password are invalid,** even when you know that you are entering your credentials 100% correctly, it may be a problem with your password.

Audible is now owned by Amazon, meaning that you can use your Amazon username and password to login. Amazon allows for very secure passwords, such as **asd;kj@!#$asldasdl!!@3123jc**. However, when you have a password that uses special characters, iTunes seems to reject them saying they are invalid. The solution to this is simple: change your password to something that is only alpha-numeric.

This issue seems to be a carry-over from the old Audible account logins, as can be seen in this [support document.](http://audible-kids.custhelp.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/3256/~/itunes-activation-error%3A-could-not-authorize-this-computer-because-either-your)
