As you may have seen in my [last post](/2011/02/01/poll-third-annual-online-photo-contest/), I was looking for a set of photos to enter into the [Ludington Center for the Arts'](http://www.ludingtonartscouncil.org/) [Third Annual Online Photo Contest](http://www.ludingtonartscouncil.org/AnnouncementRetrieve.aspx?ID=25338). Thanks to your help, I found a set of photos I'm going to submit.

I didn't enter all of the categories; I decided to go with the top three. Here they are:

## People: Summer's Set

## Animals: Buzzworthy

## Plants: Berry Cold

Again, thank you for all of your help in choosing which photos to submit. You can see all of the entires on the [Ludington Center for the Arts' page](http://www.ludingtonartscouncil.org/photo-list#data1332345) (warning: will take a **very** long time to load).

Wish me luck!
