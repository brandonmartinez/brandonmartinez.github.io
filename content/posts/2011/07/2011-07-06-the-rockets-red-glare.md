This past Saturday, I got to go on a small road-trip with my sister-in-law and her sister. We went down to Porter, Indiana to get some, umm, stuff for the holiday.

We went to [Shelton Fireworks](http://www.sheltonfireworks.com/porter.html), which is about 30 minutes past the Michigan-Indiane state line. To say that least, that place was amazing. As soon as we pulled up we were in awe; it was essentially a giant warehouse dedicated to fireworks:

When we finally got inside, we could barely believe our eyes: stacks, piles, racks, and walls full of some of the best fireworks you can get!

We ended up purchasing $250 in fireworks, which landed us a $48 credit to spend (tax-free) on more fireworks.

Here's our loot:

More importantly, though, is how well they performed. Here are the results (click on the thumbnails for larger images):

We'll definitely be doing this again next year; totally worth it!
