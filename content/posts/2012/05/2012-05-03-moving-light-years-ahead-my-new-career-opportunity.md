Officially as of today, I will be resigning my position as lead software developer with [Independent Printing Co., Inc](http://www.independentinc.com/ "Independent Printing Co., Inc."). My last day with them will be May 18th.

I'd like to thank Independent for being a great employer for the past three years (I started in 2009 as an intern). The people there are great, and the culture is enjoyable to work in. Thanks to them, I was able to get my foot in the door in the world of software development, and was able to make a fairly large impact within their organization.

However, as enjoyable as the experience has been, there always comes a point where an opportunity presents itself, offering a chance for you to grow as a person. The opportunity for me came this past Monday.

Starting May 21st, I will begin my new position as a senior software engineer with [Orion Energy Systems](http://www.oesx.com/ "Orion Energy Systems") in Manitowoc, Wisconsin.

I will still be working remotely from my home in Ludington, Michigan, and will still make occasional visits to Wisconsin for my job. From the outside looking in, you might not even know I had a new job!

I look forward to my new opportunity at Orion. Wish me the best of luck!
