## Abstract

You’ve built your first ASP.NET Core (5/DNX) web application and you’ve used
Visual Studio to deploy to your web server of choice, but what do you do next?
Automation!

Learn the new tools provided in Microsoft’s revamped .NET toolchain to build
your web application. We’ll also be making use of Microsoft’s new build and
release platform introduced in Visual Studio Team Services to take our toolchain
to the next level with Continuous Integration and Deployment.
