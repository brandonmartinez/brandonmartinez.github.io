# Brandon Martinez

Hey there! I'm Brandon – a 30-something geek working from home on the west coast
of Michigan. I live with my wife and our three awesome kids in our little
hometown.

I’m currently working remotely for [Microsoft](http://www.microsoft.com/) as a
Senior Customer Engineer. I’m primarily a C# .NET developer targeting Azure and
the cloud, but I’m also a highly-skilled web and UI developer. For more info on
my technical skills, feel free to check out
