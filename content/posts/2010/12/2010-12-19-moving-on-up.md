Can you guess who got promoted last week?

Oh sure, it's a bit of a [loaded question](http://www.google.com/search?sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8&q=define:loaded+question "Certain people questioned whether I used this term correctly, thus the link.") (this is my site after all), but it was me!

I am now the **Lead** Software Developer at [Independent Printing Co., Inc.](http://www.independentinc.com/) In addition to my previous responsibilities, I will be more involved with the planning and implementation of new programming projects at the company.

Not much more to say than that, just thought I'd make it "internet official".
