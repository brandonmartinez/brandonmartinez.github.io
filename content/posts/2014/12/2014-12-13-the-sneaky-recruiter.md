It's not uncommon to receive recruiter invites on LinkedIn and other career-oriented sites, often asking for interest in job opportunities and sharing current job experiences. For the first time, however, I received a "sneaky" message:

> Hey Brandon!
> 
> My name is \[REDACTED\], and I am an IT Staffing Specialist working on several .NET Development opportunities. As I am not the most technical person in the world, I was doing some research on Stack Overflow, and came across your profile. I wondered if you might be able to explain to me the difference in ASP.net as compared to VB.net, C# and MVC programming? We have opportunities that vary within all of these realms, and I thought you might be able to help me out since you have a lot of experience. Let me know if we could speak briefly, my number is \[REDACTED\].
> 
> Thanks! I hope to hear from you soon!
> 
> \-\[REDACTED\]

Now, this very well could be a genuine request. But, I'm leaning towards this being a sneak way to get me to interview with them.

What I'm wondering, though, is should I respond to something like this? Wouldn't it look bad on me if I wasn't able to see through this thinly veiled attempt at a point of contact? Wouldn't the right thing to do be to not answer? I think I'll go with that.

And in case you missed it, [Tricia Curry](http://bmtn.us/12Zasgz "Tricia Curry on Twitter") and the [@msdevshow](http://bmtn.us/1qHvHi9 "Real Developer Potpourri with Trish Curry | msdevshow.com") hosts read and discussed this on the air. Give [the episode](http://bmtn.us/1qHvHi9 "Real Developer Potpourri with Trish Curry | msdevshow.com") a listen (I'm name-dropped a few times, even).
