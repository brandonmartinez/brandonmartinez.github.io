Alright, important update for everyone: earlier today I was using the elliptical
machine when I felt a sudden, and major, increase in my heart rate. After ending
my workout, I rested and decided to self-monitor and see how my heart rate would
proceed.

After an hour or so, I was still feeling an intense, irregular heartbeat. Per
Joy's pushing me to go to the ER, we went to Spectrum Health Ludington Hospital
where I was hooked up to an EKG, heart monitor, and blood pressure cuff.

My heart rate was 250+. They basically unloaded the pharmacy into me to try and
get my rate and rhythm under control (5 to 6 medications at multiple doses).
They had no effect on my condition.

Next step was to send a shock and try to reboot my heart. They wired me up, put
me out, and proceeded to try a reboot. The initial thought was that they'd be
able to do this in a single jolt. It took **four** (my primary nurse said I
almost gave _her_ a heart attack).

They were able to get my heart back to an acceptable rate. After they were able
to look at the results of the EKG and consult with a cardiologist, it is assumed
I have
[Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolff%E2%80%93Parkinson%E2%80%93White_syndrome).

I am currently headed to Spectrum in Grand Rapids via ambulance. I will be
seeing a specialist and will most likely have a procedure done tomorrow.

Thank you for all of the support, prayers, and otherwise that I have received. I
thank God and all of the amazing medical staff that took care of me and made
sure my heart didn't explode. I'll post an update when I have more information.
