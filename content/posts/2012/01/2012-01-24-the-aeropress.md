After being [persuaded](http://5by5.tv/buildanalyze/34) by [Marco Arment's](http://www.marco.org/) constant praise, I have finally ordered an [AeroPress](http://aerobie.com/products/aeropress.htm).

There's not much to say here, except that I totally agree with him: it makes some of the best coffee I've ever had. I've been using it for the past few days in place of [my percolator](https://www.brandonmartinez.com/2011/09/30/drip-to-perc-a-coffee-story/ "Drip to Perc: A Coffee Story")\[footnote\]1\[/footnote\], and both Joy and I love the quality of coffee that it makes. I do, however, need to pickup some [local, high-quality beans](https://www.facebook.com/redolencia) to see this at its optimum.

Some additional info from the manufacturer:

> **Smoothest:** Using the ideal water temperature and gentle air pressure brewing yields rich flavor with lower acidity and without bitterness.
> 
> **Richest**: Total immersion brewing results in uniform extraction of the ultimate in full coffee flavor. Other coffee makers drip hot water on bed of grounds, over extracting at the center and under extracting at the edge.
> 
> **Purest**: Micro filtered for grit free coffee – unlike other press-type coffee makers.
> 
> **Fastest**: One minute from start to enjoy. The actual press time takes only 20 seconds.

Interested? Order one at [Amazon.com](http://www.amazon.com/Aerobie-AeroPress-Coffee-Espresso-Maker/dp/B0047BIWSK/ "Aeropress on Amazon").

\[footnote name="1"\]Will this replace my percolator? No. If I want to make a lot of good coffee, that will still be my method of choice. **UPDATE:** I lied; it did. I make two full presses into a carafe.\[/footnote\]
