For the Super Bowl, I decided to try out a new wing recipe: [Alton Brown's Buffalo Wings](http://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/good-eats/buffalo-wings-recipe/index.html). Now, something you may not know, but [Alton Brown](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alton_Brown) happens to be one of my personal heroes. Sure, he's a little crazy, but that's what makes him so interesting to watch; that, and almost everything he makes looks amazing! Anyway, here's a quick overview of the recipe, along with a few changes:

## Ingredients

- 12 whole chicken wings (Joy just bought a bag of pre-cut wings)
- Sauce(s) of your choice to toss the wings in

## Directions

Place a 6-quart saucepan with a steamer basket and 1-inch of water in the bottom, over high heat, cover and bring to a boil: [![](http://assets.brandonmartinez.com/brandonmartinez/2011/02/20110205024-575x383.jpg "Getting the steaming basket setup ready.")](http://assets.brandonmartinez.com/brandonmartinez/2011/02/20110205024.jpg)

Remove the tips of the wings and discard or save for making stock. Using kitchen shears, or a knife, separate the wings at the joint. Thanks to buying pre-cut wings, I didn't have to do this step.

Place the wings into the steamer basket, cover, reduce the heat to medium and steam for 10 minutes. [![](http://assets.brandonmartinez.com/brandonmartinez/2011/02/20110205026-575x383.jpg "Steamin' 'em up!")](http://assets.brandonmartinez.com/brandonmartinez/2011/02/20110205026.jpg)

Remove the wings from the basket and carefully pat dry. Lay the wings out on a cooling rack set in a half sheet pan lined with paper towels. [![](http://assets.brandonmartinez.com/brandonmartinez/2011/02/20110205061-575x383.jpg "Hanging out, waiting to go into the fridge.")](http://assets.brandonmartinez.com/brandonmartinez/2011/02/20110205061.jpg)

Place in the refrigerator for 1 hour (I actually did this overnight; they still turned out fine). [![](http://assets.brandonmartinez.com/brandonmartinez/2011/02/20110205063-575x383.jpg "Coolin' off.")](http://assets.brandonmartinez.com/brandonmartinez/2011/02/20110205063.jpg)

Preheat the oven to 425Â°F. Replace the paper towels with parchment paper. Roast on the middle rack of the oven for 20 minutes. Turn the wings over and cook another 20 minutes or until meat is cooked through and the skin is golden brown. _Note: do **not** use wax paper; the wings will stick and be a total pain to get off the tray._

_Sorry, no pic for this one (I forgot)._

Remove the wings from the oven and transfer to a bowl to toss with the sauce; toss the wings (don't make a mess!). Serve warm.

And finally, enjoy! Honestly, these were some of the best wings I've ever made. I've made them several ways before (grilled, fried, etc), and this is tops.
