Happy Thanksgiving, everyone! It's that time of year where we take a moment to reflect on everything that we're thankful for. I don't know about you, but I there's a lot in my life that sometimes gets taken for granted.

I have an amazing family. Joy and I [welcomed our newest addition, Seth](http://www.sethmartinez.com/ "Seth Martinez"), this past June.

We have a house a car, and are able to live comfortably while only maintaining one job.

And speaking of job, that's pretty awesome, too. I've been with [the company](http://www.independentinc.com/) for a year-and-a-half, and managed to land [a nice promotion last December](https://www.brandonmartinez.com/2010/12/19/moving-on-up/ "Moving onÂ Up"). Even better, I also get to work from home. Granted, it has its own challenges (e.g. separating work-life from home-life), but it's been one of the biggest blessings that we as a family could ask for.

These are just some of the "big ones" from the past year or so. There are many other things to be thankful for, and I'll definitely be thinking about them throughout the day, and continue to throughout the entire year.

Have a Happy Thanksgiving!
