I've been working for the [Ferris State Torch](http://www.fsutorch.com/) for the past semester, mainly as the web editor. However, when I get the opportunity, I try to submit opinion pieces and even occasionally take photos. Check out my latest opinion piece, titled ["Hit Me on the Tweet Side"](http://www.fsutorch.com/2009/11/18/opinions/hit-me-on-the-tweet-side/).
