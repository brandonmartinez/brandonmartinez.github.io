The largest tech and geek conference in the Midwest! I am a volunteer core team
member mostly working on social media and external brand management, but also
on occasion working with their custom code platforms to help run the conference
and pre-conference events throughout the year.

During the conference, I am also the official photographer for the event,
working to capture all of the awesome stuff that happens during this multi-day
conference.
