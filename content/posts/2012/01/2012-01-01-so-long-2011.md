Overall, 2011 was a great year. Normally, I'd take this opportunity to reflect on all of the things that have happened over the year, but it's our biggest event that stands over everything else: the birth of [of our son](http://www.sethmartinez.com/).

That event started one of the best chapters in our life: parenthood. Joy and I have had a lot of fun, and some struggles, learning the ins-and-outs of parenthood. We would never change any of it for the world, and only look forward to continuing the growth of our family.

Here's to 2012 and the many years to come.
