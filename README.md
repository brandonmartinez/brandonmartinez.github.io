# Brandon Martinez

Hey there! ðŸ‘‹ I'm Brandon â€“ a 30-something geek working from home on the west
coast of Michigan. I live with my wife and our three awesome kids in our little
hometown.

I'm a seasoned software developer and enthusiast with a knack for web, cloud,
and platform development. I've spent my career diving into everything from
backend servers to user-friendly interfaces, always eager to embrace the latest
tech and create rock-solid solutions.

In my previous roles, I was a full-stack engineer specializing in both Microsoft
and open source technologies. I excelled in developing web applications that
embraced modern standards, and I was known for my DevOps skills in automated
build-and-deployment scenarios both on premises and in the cloud.

I've since made the transition into a role as a technical advisor for
independent software vendors (ISVs), digital natives, and startups. Leveraging
my extensive background in software development, Software as a Service (SaaS)
best practices and strategy, and cloud technologies, I'm now focused on helping
ISVs migrate, modernize, and optimize their operations on Microsoft Azure. It's
a thrilling shift that merges my love for development with a fresh focus on
business strategy in the cloud.

Beyond the code and architecture, I'm all about team spirit and mentoring.
Whether leading projects or sharing insights through speaking engagements and
blogs, I'm here to bring a mix of technical know-how and a wealth of advice to
the table.
