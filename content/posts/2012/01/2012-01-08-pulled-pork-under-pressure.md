I've been thinking about using my pressure cooker, since it's been quite a while, and Joy happened to buy some pork butt a few days ago; so I thought, what better than pulled pork?

**Update!** I have updated the recipe with a fully visual guide. Enjoy!

## Ingredients

- ~4 lbs Pork Butt (also called shoulder)
- 1/2 stick of butter
- 1 large onion (I used 3 small ones)
- 1 tbsp minced garlic
- 1/2 tsp salt (I used MSG)
- 1/2 tsp ground black pepper
- 1/2 tsp chili powder
- 1/2 tsp cayenne pepper
- 1/2 tsp ground cumin
- 1/2 tsp Old Bay seasoning

## Hardware

- 1 Medium-Sized Pressure Cooker
- 2 Large Bowls
- Colander
- Frying Pan
- Utensils and small bowls for holding items

## Directions

Combine the salt, pepper, chili powder, cayenne, cumin, and Old bay into a small dish and set aside:

Get your onions, garlic, and butter together:

[![Approximately 2 cups of onion and a tablespoon of garlic, along with half a stick of butter.](http://assets.brandonmartinez.com/brandonmartinez/2012/01/20130923148-1200x799.jpg)](http://assets.brandonmartinez.com/brandonmartinez/2012/01/20130923148.jpg)

Chop your onions:

Gather all of your veggies into a bowl then set aside for a few:

[![Ready to cook](http://assets.brandonmartinez.com/brandonmartinez/2012/01/20130923151-1200x799.jpg)](http://assets.brandonmartinez.com/brandonmartinez/2012/01/20130923151.jpg)

Get the cooker on the stove and set to a medium or medium-high heat. Melt the half-stick of butter:

[![Melt the butter at the bottom of the cooker](http://assets.brandonmartinez.com/brandonmartinez/2012/01/20130923153-1200x799.jpg)](http://assets.brandonmartinez.com/brandonmartinez/2012/01/20130923153.jpg)

Once the butter has melted, sautÃ© the veggies:

While the veggies are sautÃ©ing, get the meat out. I pre-seasoned mine the night before with sea salt, coarse ground pepper, and chili powder:

[![Get the meat ready; just under 4 pounds here.](http://assets.brandonmartinez.com/brandonmartinez/2012/01/20130923157-1200x799.jpg)](http://assets.brandonmartinez.com/brandonmartinez/2012/01/20130923157.jpg)

Once the veggies are cooked, remove them and set aside:

[![Remove veggies and place aside.](http://assets.brandonmartinez.com/brandonmartinez/2012/01/20130923159-1200x799.jpg)](http://assets.brandonmartinez.com/brandonmartinez/2012/01/20130923159.jpg)

Put the meat in the cooker and brown both sides:

[![Brown each side of the meat.](http://assets.brandonmartinez.com/brandonmartinez/2012/01/20130923158-1200x799.jpg)](http://assets.brandonmartinez.com/brandonmartinez/2012/01/20130923158.jpg)

Add your veggies back in. Lookin' good!

[![Mmmm, lookin' good!](http://assets.brandonmartinez.com/brandonmartinez/2012/01/20130923160-1200x799.jpg)](http://assets.brandonmartinez.com/brandonmartinez/2012/01/20130923160.jpg)

Remove the cooker from the stove and fill approximately halfway with water. Most, if not all, of the meat should be covered:

[![Fill the cooker approximately halfway with water. Most, if not all, of the meat should be covered.](http://assets.brandonmartinez.com/brandonmartinez/2012/01/20130923163.jpg)](http://assets.brandonmartinez.com/brandonmartinez/2012/01/20130923163.jpg)

Return to the stove and mix in your seasoning:

[![Mix in the seasoning.](http://assets.brandonmartinez.com/brandonmartinez/2012/01/20130923165-1200x799.jpg)](http://assets.brandonmartinez.com/brandonmartinez/2012/01/20130923165.jpg)

Close the cooker and set your heat to high. Cook for 60 to 90 minutes:

[![Close it up, set it on high, and cook for 60 - 90 minutes.](http://assets.brandonmartinez.com/brandonmartinez/2012/01/20130923167.jpg)](http://assets.brandonmartinez.com/brandonmartinez/2012/01/20130923167.jpg)

Dance!

When your time is up, remove the cooker from the stove and place under cold running water. This helps reduce the pressure faster so you can open it:

Open the lid and smell the awesome!

Remove the cooker from the stove and pour the contents into a colander placed in a large bowl. You're going to want keep those juices:

Look at how perfect that is:

[![Perfect](http://assets.brandonmartinez.com/brandonmartinez/2012/01/20130923188-1200x799.jpg)](http://assets.brandonmartinez.com/brandonmartinez/2012/01/20130923188.jpg)

Transfer pork into a large bowl or a large clean surface; you can now start the pulling/shredding process:

[![Time to start pulling! If you let your meat cook for over an hour, this phase should be very easy.](http://assets.brandonmartinez.com/brandonmartinez/2012/01/20130923192-1200x799.jpg)](http://assets.brandonmartinez.com/brandonmartinez/2012/01/20130923192.jpg)

After pulling, pour some of the juice onto the pork to moisten it a bit more. Here's a protip if you have more time: transfer pork into a slow cooker, pour juices to cover the meat, keep cooker on low for a few hours; the flavor is amazing!

[![I like to take some of the juice and pour it over the meat once it's been pulled.](http://assets.brandonmartinez.com/brandonmartinez/2012/01/20130923204-1200x799.jpg)](http://assets.brandonmartinez.com/brandonmartinez/2012/01/20130923204.jpg)

Now that our pork is done, we can make a gravy to use as an optional topping. Pour some of the leftover juice into a frying pan, heat to high, then mix in cornstarch mixed with cold water. You can follow [this guide](http://www.simplyrecipes.com/recipes/how_to_make_gravy/ "SimplyRecipes | How to Make Gravy") for additional help.

We're ready to make our sandwiches!

[![All setup and ready to make sammiches!](http://assets.brandonmartinez.com/brandonmartinez/2012/01/20130923218-1200x799.jpg)](http://assets.brandonmartinez.com/brandonmartinez/2012/01/20130923218.jpg)

## Additional Tips

- Coleslaw: I **love** coleslaw on these types of sandwiches (I love it in general, too). If you happen to live near a Meijer, their coleslaw is excellent.
- Mashed Potatoes: If you want a hearty, filling sandwich, I recommend making some mashed potatoes to layer on top of the bead.
- Pretzel Buns: if they're on sale, Joy and I normally pick up pretzel sub buns for pulled pork. Awesome bread to eat it on.
- Sauces: we already made some gravy, but you can also add a line or two of BBQ sauce.
- Preferred Stacking Order: open faced bun, layer of mashed potatoes, layer of pulled pork, layer of coleslaw, topped with a little bit of gravy and BBQ sauce.
