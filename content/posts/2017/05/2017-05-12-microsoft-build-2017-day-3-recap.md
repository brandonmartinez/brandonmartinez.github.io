Day three of Microsoft Build 2017 did not have a keynote, but that doesn't mean
it ends without content to fill the day. Today will be focused on sessions, "The
Hub", and catching some of the Channel 9 Live production happening right here at
the conference. Here's a recap of the day.

# Sessions

The session I attended today continued to focus on containers, serverless
architecture, and the new features coming to both C# and .NET.

## Developing on Windows Server: Innovation for Today and Tomorrow - Containers, Docker, .NET Core, Service Fabric, and More

Just because we have legacy applications doesn't mean we are stuck completely in
the past; the Windows Server team is working hard to give as many options as
possible to help modernize our application's underlying infrastructure. This
session covered the Windows Core and Windows Nano container images, the latter
of which will be coming later this year; these images will help create .NET
applications that can run in a container-friendly environment such as Service
Fabric or in Hyper-V right within Windows Server.

Additionally, new Hyper-V technology will be coming to allow Linux to be
properly containerized on Windows Server and Windows 10. This will allow for a
mix and match scenario of Linux and Windows containers all running on Windows
server. The possibilities to upgrade our legacy applications into modern
infrastructure is becoming easier and more affordable year-over-year.

## A Day in the Life of an Azure Serverless Developer

There are two buzzwords I've heard in almost every session: containers and
serverless. Both of these concepts have the potential to totally shake up the
way we think about developing, deploying, and managing our applications. This
session demonstrated the flexibility that a serverless workflow can offer a
developer: finding a bug in production, fixing and testing it locally, deploying
to a staging environment, and finally pushing the fix to production, all in a
serverless scenario with a CI/CD pipeline. These concepts are very exciting, and
I really look forward to using and implementing these ideas in projects.

## The Future of C

C# is a constantly growing and developing language. It's one of the top most
popular and loved languages, as cited by a last year's
[Stack Overflow developer survey](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2016).
In this session, we discussed the new features coming to C# 7.1 (which speaking
of, point releases will be a new concept going forward as well). This includes
some improvements to the new tuple method returns, pattern matching, and
[more](https://github.com/dotnet/csharplang/milestone/5).

## SignalR .NET Core: Realtime Cross-Platform Open Web Communication

[![](http://assets.brandonmartinez.com/brandonmartinez/2017/05/20170512134-Web-1200x900.jpg)](http://assets.brandonmartinez.com/brandonmartinez/2017/05/20170512134-Web.jpg)

As someone who followed the progress of SignalR on .NET Core just to watch it
get dropped back in the initial release, it was a relief to hear that
substantial progress is being made. While the current version that runs with
ASP.NET Core 1.x is now deprecated (though, technically usable to some degree),
the SignalR team has taken this delay as an opportunity to completely rewrite
the underlying architecture. I'm excited to see how flexible and powerful
SignalR becomes, especially in the area of being able to scale to very large
domains.

# The Hub

[![](http://assets.brandonmartinez.com/brandonmartinez/2017/05/20170512092-Web-1200x900.jpg)](http://assets.brandonmartinez.com/brandonmartinez/2017/05/20170512092-Web.jpg)

The Hub is the place to be if you want to talk to Microsoft's product teams and
engineers. It's an open floor of information, discussion, and quick-and-direct
access to the teams that build the services you use every day.

I was able to have excellent discussions with the Cosmos DB team in addition to
other Azure services. I was also able to chat with some of the Visual Studio
team members and give feedback on some of the new 2017 features. It's hard to
pass up an opportunity like this, and I'm thankful that Microsoft is so open to
these discussions.

# Channel 9 Studio

[![](http://assets.brandonmartinez.com/brandonmartinez/2017/05/20170512094-Web-1200x900.jpg)](http://assets.brandonmartinez.com/brandonmartinez/2017/05/20170512094-Web.jpg)

As part of the conference, Microsoft builds a TV studio right in the conference
center. Channel 9 then records interviews and Q&A sessions with conference
speakers and other community representatives. It's fun to stand on the sidelines
and watch these interviews in person, then to go and see them later on the
Channel 9 website.

If you weren't able to make it to Build this year, or if you want to catch a
session that you missed, be sure to check out the
[Build 2017 stream on Channel 9](https://channel9.msdn.com/Events/Build/2017).

# Final Remarks and Closing the Conference

This conference was amazing! I'm so thankful that I was able to attend and
experience the largest Microsoft tech conference of the year. It was a valuable
learning and networking opportunity, and I will definitely be able to put these
new skills and connections to use. Thank you Microsoft for putting on an amazing
event!
