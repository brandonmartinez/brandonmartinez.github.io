As I mentioned in a previous post, Joy has been out of town for the last few days. To occupy my time, I've been trying to come up with small projects. Sunday's project: create a panorama of the breakwall at Stearn's Park/Beach.

Here's the end result ([Large Preview](http://assets.brandonmartinez.com/brandonmartinez/2010/08/20100802001full.jpg)):

It was quite an involved process to create this panorama. Here's an overview of all the steps it took to make this:

1. Using my tripod and my [Panamatic](http://www.lenspen.com/403/381/) mount, I took 12 sets of 3 pictures. Each set was 30Â° apart, taken with three different exposures (-2, 0, and 2 EV).
2. Processed each of the 12 sets as an HDR using [Photomatix](http://www.hdrsoft.com/) (the output of each set is shown below).
3. Stitched the 12 completed photos into the panorama using [DoubleTake](http://echoone.com/doubletake/); this resulted in a 61 megapixel photo.
4. Opened the output in [Photoshop](http://www.adobe.com/products/photoshop/photoshop/) to check for any weirdness from the stitching (i.e. blurred people, duplicated landscape, etc).
5. Imported that output into [Lightroom](http://www.adobe.com/products/photoshoplightroom/), made a few color corrections, and then exported the final photo.

The 12 HDR photos:

In total, this project took between 4 and 6 hours of work (not including taking the actual pictures). I'm looking to get it printed on canvas through [Canvas Press](http://www.canvaspress.com/), which is looking to cost around $100-$200 for an 80" x 8" @ 300 DPI print. If you're interested in getting a print as well, feel free to [contact me](/contact/).
