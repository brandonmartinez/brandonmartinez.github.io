A podcast about nothing, but everything at the same time. I'm a co-host with
one of my best friends, Kenny, where we talk about whatever is on our minds
or going on in the worlds of gaming, media, and even in our personal day-to-day.

We try to publish bi-weekly, though slip on occasion. Check us out on iTunes or
subscribe via Facebook or YouTube!
