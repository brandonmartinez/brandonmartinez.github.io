I've been looking into getting a small, semi-portable studio setup. Currently, I have a [backdrop stand](https://www.brandonmartinez.com/camera-gear/#ravellistand) and a [Canon Speedlite 430 EX II](https://www.brandonmartinez.com/camera-gear/#canon430speedlite). However, I would like to take it to the next level.

After posting a question on [reddit](http://www.reddit.com/r/photography/comments/nvypr/looking_for_suggestions_on_lighting_setupskits/ "Looking for suggestions on lighting setups/kits @ reddit.com"), searching the [Adorama](http://www.adorama.com/) and [Calumet](http://www.calumetphoto.com/) photography supply sites, and reading several forums and reviews, including a great article [on Strobist](http://strobist.blogspot.com/2009/11/choosing-big-lights-alienbees.html "Strobist: Choosing Big Lights"), I've landed on an [AlienBees](http://www.paulcbuff.com/alienbees.php "AlienBees") setup.

Before getting into the proposed setup, I'd like to address a common question I've been asked: "_what_ do I want to use these lights for?" I'd like to use them for a small home-studio setup, primarily for portraits; I'd like it somewhat portable, since I don't have a lot of room in my house (I'd have to accommodate, then teardown), and on occasion I'd like to take the setup elsewhere. Eventually, I'd also like to use them outdoors (using a power-pack or really long extension cord) for outdoor portraits.

So far, I've come up with this:

## The Lights

- **Model:** [AlienBees B800](http://www.paulcbuff.com/b800.php)
- **Quantity:** 2
- **Price:** $279.95/each

## The Modifiers

- **Model:** [Soft Silver PLMâ„¢, 64" with 8mm mounting shaft](http://www.paulcbuff.com/plm-softsilver.php)
- **Quantity:** 1
- **Price:** $49.95/each

I decided only one would be necessary at the moment. I'd like to eventually get a softbox, too.

## The Stands

[![](http://assets.brandonmartinez.com/brandonmartinez/2012/01/ls3050_front_0111-575x575.jpg "ls3050_front_0111")](http://assets.brandonmartinez.com/brandonmartinez/2012/01/ls3050_front_0111.jpg)

- **Model:** [10-foot General Purpose Light Stand](http://www.paulcbuff.com/ls3050.php)
- **Quantity:** 2
- **Price:** $39.95/each

## Connectivity

- **Model:** [Speedlite Foot Adapter](http://www.paulcbuff.com/slfa.php)
- **Quantity:** 1
- **Price:** $15.95/each

From my understanding, I should be able to use my speedlite with this adapter, and use the other AlienBees strobe via the optical trigger.

## The Grand Total

The total for all of these:

- **Order Subtotal:** $705.70
- **Order Discount (for purchasing two flash-units):** -$14.58
- **Shipping:** $34.25
- **–**
- **Grand Total:**$725.37
