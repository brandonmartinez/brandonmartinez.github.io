If you want QuickTime Player 7 on your new Lion install, you can download a working copy from Apple here: [QuickTime Player 7.6.6 for Mac OS X v10.6.3](http://support.apple.com/kb/dl923 "QuickTime Player 7.6.6 for Mac OS X v10.6.3").

One other note: apparently, this version requires a license. You'll want to [purchase that from Apple](http://store.apple.com/us/product/D3380Z/A).
