A Registered Student Organization at Ferris State University. I was a member my
first year at FSU, then became the Commissioner at Large for my senior year.
Primary responsibilities were communications with members and external
entities. Helped introduce new technologies for communication across the
organization, including revamping their web presence and providing dedicated
email accounts to all members.
