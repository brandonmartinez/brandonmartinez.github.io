In rebuilding one of our _Definitions of Done_, I came across this excellent resource from the [Scrum Alliance](http://www.scrumalliance.org/ "Scrum Alliance"): [Definition of Done: A Reference](http://www.scrumalliance.org/articles/106-definition-of-done-a-reference "Scrum Alliance - Definition of Done: A Reference").

One of the best points that the article makes is that the DoD is a very unique and specific document for every team (and every project). The article gives the example of the _"Done" Thinking Grid_, outlining many of the possible areas to check for doneness:

If you're working on a DoD, or just want to review yours, I highly recommend reading the whole article. Lots of great ideas and points to check.
