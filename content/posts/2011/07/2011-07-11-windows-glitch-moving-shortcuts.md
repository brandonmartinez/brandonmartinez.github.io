I am having the oddest Windows 7 glitch: one of my shortcuts keeps moving!

At first, I thought I was crazy. I must have been moving my desktop shortcuts by accident, or maybe arranging them somehow. But after observing my desktop over the course of an hour, it looks like there really is a glitch.

Here's a small section of my desktop, along with a few icons:

After a short amount of time, this shortcut keeps moving to this location:

It's the only shortcut that does it, and it always moves to the next available spot on the left side of the screen.

Does anyone have any ideas on why this is happening?
