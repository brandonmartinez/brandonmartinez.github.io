Thanks to anyone that came out to
[watch my presentation at THAT Conference](https://www.thatconference.com/sessions/session/11122).
If you're looking for slides, source, or other materials, you can find all of
those on
[GitHub](https://github.com/brandonmartinez/mm-gulp-grunt-webpack-comparison).
The
[slides can also be viewed on GitHub Pages](https://brandonmartinez.github.io/mm-gulp-grunt-webpack-comparison/slides/#/).

I would also love to see a pull request from anyone that would like to do a full
pipeline of webpack (using loaders and such). My requirements are that you use
the existing assets (mostly) untouched to accommodate webpack.

Thanks again if you made it out to my talk; I hope you enjoyed it as well as the
conference!
