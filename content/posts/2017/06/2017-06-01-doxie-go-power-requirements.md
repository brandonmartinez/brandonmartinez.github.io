Recently my [Doxie Go](http://www.getdoxie.com/product/doxie-go/)'s battery has
been… acting up; essentially, it won't charge over USB anymore. I've had the
scanner now for a few years, so it's not terribly surprising that the internal
battery may be starting to act up; however, I've been really pleased with the
Doxie Go and didn't want to replace it as my primary scanner.

Luckily, there is a port on the side to plug-in an external power supply (it
does charge over USB normally, but there's not enough power to charge the
battery and scan at the same time). Since I was in a bit of a pinch to get some
documents scanned, I popped over to my local Walmart and bought one of these:

However, I wasn't quite sure what power settings I needed. After some major
digging, I found an Amazon review that lists the power output of the official
[Doxie Worldwide Power Adapter](http://help.getdoxie.com/doxiego/faq/scanner/chargeandscan/).
If you need to do something similar, you need to set your AC adapter to an
output of **6V DC @ 1.5amps with a center positive polarity**. Hopefully this
helps someone else!
