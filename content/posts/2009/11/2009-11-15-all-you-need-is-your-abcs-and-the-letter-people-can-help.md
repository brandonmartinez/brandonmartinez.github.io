In lower elementary school, I would guess K-2, there was a show that we watched to help us learn the alphabet: The Letter People Show. This show revolved around puppets that represented each letter. For some reason, this is one of those things from my child hood that I have always remembered, and the other day I decided to do something about it.

After spending a while trying to actually find the name of the show (I guess it comes from the [ALPHA-ONE](http://seedyroad.com/academics/elementary.htm) program), it was just a quick Youtube search away. Checkout the video for Mr. M (pictured to the right) on [Youtube](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GS8GTWOSA60).
