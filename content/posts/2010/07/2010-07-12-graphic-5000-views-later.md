A few weeks ago I made a post pertaining to the recently released iOS 4.0 update for iPhone 3G and 3GS (as well as iPod Touch 2G and up): I gave my two-cents on how to [speed up the iPhone 3G](https://www.brandonmartinez.com/2010/06/23/get-a-faster-iphone-3g-with-ios-4/). After I wrote that, I posted the link at 3 or 4 Apple-related sites. It's amazing how much traffic that brought in.

If you noticed, that post has brought in almost 5,000 views on its own, which is way more than any other post on my blog; not too mention, the [search terms](http://www.google.com/search?client=safari&rls=en&q=make+iphone+3G+4.0+faster&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8 "Google Search: make iphone 3G 4.0 faster") that have brought some of the traffic are cool, too. I'm not sure if that's a sign I need to start writing about more trending topics, or if I should be promoting my posts across various sites to get the traffic boost (i.e. link my photo stream on other photo-blogs).

\[update\]The post has exceeded 5,000 views as of today.\[/update\]

Any suggestions?
