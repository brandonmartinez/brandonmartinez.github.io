Usually when I post a recipe it's my own creation derived and inspired from several other recipes or family secrets. This time, however, I just want to share an excellent hummus recipe that I found.

You can find the recipe here:

Per my usual style, I did make a few tweaks to their recipe:

- 3/4 the amount of lemon juice (otherwise it gets a bit too tangy, in my opinion)
- Doubled the requested amount of garlic
- In addition to the cumin, I also added some red curry powder

And one more thing: I love this site. It has excellent directions and often shows great photos and videos on how to prepare the various dishes. Check out some of their other recipes!
