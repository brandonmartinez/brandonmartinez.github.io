  I know it's been a sparse year of posting content. If you want to follow me on
  a more regular basis, I have many social media accounts you can follow for
  when I do post intermittently.

I know it's been a sparse year of posting content. If you want to follow me on a
more regular basis, check out my [twitter](http://twitter.brandonmartinez.com/)
and [instagram](https://www.instagram.com/brandonmartinez/) accounts. If you're
looking for a more professional relationship, I'm also available on
[LinkedIn](http://linkedin.brandonmartinez.com/).

I also have a couple side projects you can check out:

- [The Average Enthusiasts](http://www.theaverageenthusiasts.com/): a podcast I
  run with a friend aboutâ€¦ nothing? Everything? Something?
- [Reachable Heights](http://www.reachableheights.com/): a place where I make
  music with friends.

These are in addition to the other handful of things I do with my employer,
[Skyline Technologies](http://www.skylinetechnologies.com/), my small side
business, [Martinez Media](http://www.martinezmedia.net/), my geek friends over
at [THAT Conference](https://www.thatconference.com/), and my church-fam at the
[Radiant Coast](http://www.radiantcoast.org/).

And of course, Joy, Seth, Perry, and Poppy (our newest addition) keep me busy!

Thanks for sticking around; I'll post content when I can, but definitely check
me out on all those other platforms.
