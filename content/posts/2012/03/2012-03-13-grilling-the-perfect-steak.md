The weather has been getting very nice the past few days, so why not put it to good use? Time to grill!

Joy and I decided to treat ourselves and picked up two New York Strip steaks. Being that they were rather nice cuts, I decided to do some research beforehand for grilling tips. I found this excellent video put together by [Char-Broil](http://www.charbroil.com/Recipe/Tips/2429/Grilling-The-Perfect-New-York-Strip.aspx "Char-Broil: GRILLING THE PERFECT NEW YORK STRIP"), giving suggestions on cooking our cut of meat on a very similar infrared grill as mine:

Following the recommendations in the video, the steaks came out perfectly. They had a beautiful crust on the outside with a perfect, tender and juicy inside. Arguably some of the best steaks I've made:

As for the sides, I finished the plates off with [grilled asparagus](http://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/the-surreal-gourmet/grilled-asparagus-spears-recipe/index.html "Grilled Asparagus Spears @ foodnetwork.com") and a baked red potato.

I would highly recommend watching the video and trying the recommendations on your own. I know I'll be following them again.
