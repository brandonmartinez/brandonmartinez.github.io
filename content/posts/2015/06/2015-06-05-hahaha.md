A different post from what I normally put here, but this rings true to me:

[![hahahaha](http://assets.brandonmartinez.com/brandonmartinez/2015/06/anh-bia-facebook__Vtech360.com-32.jpg)](http://assets.brandonmartinez.com/brandonmartinez/2015/06/anh-bia-facebook__Vtech360.com-32.jpg)

I've never been a fan of "LOL", so I just fall back to "hahaha" when IM'ing. A
coworker had sent this to me a few months ago and I've been waiting for an
opportunity to use it. Sadly, that hasn't arisen yet, so instead you get a blog
post.
