After 30 to 45 minutes of waiting on a few Vimeo files to "process", I finally decided to upgrade to a Pro account. I've been doing some more screencasting, and would like to continue creating more videos. I'm happy to announce that my first channel is live: [Photography and Post-Processing](http://bmtn.us/1y3eXTD "Photography and Post-Processing | Vimeo").

I hope to capture some more screencasts than just on this channel, including some tech screens. If anyone has any suggestions, feel free to leave them in the comments.
