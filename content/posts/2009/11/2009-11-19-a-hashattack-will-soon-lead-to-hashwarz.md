There's a new game in the [twitter world](http://www.twitter.com/), and it revolves around [#hashtags](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23hashtags). After an interesting discussion with some fellow classmates, we came up with an interesting idea. We could create hashtags based on a person and what they're doing (or something relevant to them).

For example, a recent tweet from our friend Nanette:

Led to a [#hashattack](https://twitter.com/#search?q=%23hashattack) based on the [#nanettesafilipino](https://twitter.com/#search?q=%23nanettesafilipino) hashtag:

The best part of doing this is that you can look back to see how a person was acting, what they were doing, and what everyone thought about it. For example, if you have a friend, Sam, who is often out of line, you could create [#samisoutofline](https://twitter.com/#search?q=%23samisoutofline). From there, anytime he acts up, throw up a tweet with that hashtag, wait a few weeks, then check the tag and see how many times he's done-been-acting-up.

Of course, the possibilities with a [#hashattack](https://twitter.com/#search?q=%23hashattack) are endless here. Experiment, have fun, and let me know what else you come up with. Maybe you'll even start some [#hashwarz](https://twitter.com/#search?q=%23hashwarz).
