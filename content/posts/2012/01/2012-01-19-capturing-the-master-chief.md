I've been experimenting with the [new light set](https://www.brandonmartinez.com/2012/01/06/lights-purchased/ "Lights: Purchased!") I purchased: portraits, candid room shots, food, and so on. Last night's experiment: action figures.

Here's the final result:

And here's the setup:

Basically, I had the two AlienBees setup at a 45° angle from the center, set to low power, and pointed down at the subject. From there, it was adjusting the composition in-camera, and making sure settings lined up.

Overall, I think the photo turned out great. I think my only complaint is that I wish the scenery wasn't so boring.
