Northeast Wisconsiners, book your calendars! I'll be speaking at the
[NEWCodeCamp](http://newcodecamp.com/ 'NEWCodeCamp') on March 28th.

I'll be bringing my tried-and-tested talk on
[JavaScript Promises](https://www.brandonmartinez.com/2014/08/11/that-conference-presentation-recap-from-callback-hell-to-the-javascript-promise-land/ 'THAT Conference Presentation Recap: From Callback Hell to the JavaScript “Promise” Land').
Looking forward to seeing you all there!
