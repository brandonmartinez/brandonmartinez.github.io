If you read my [last post](https://www.brandonmartinez.com/2010/09/01/a-charter-communication-mishap/ "A Charter Communication Mishap") regarding my Charter Communications experience, you'd know I was anything but happy. Well, today I received an interesting comment on that post.

From Umatter2Charter:

Wow, apparently they found my post. I didn't know if it was real at first (it actually was in my spam queue), but I decided to give it a shot just to see what happened.

I contacted the provided email address with all the required information, and in less than 15 minutes I received a phone call. It was Eric from Charter.

He told me that the transfer fee had been waived, and that he was going to lower my cable and internet package rates (all said and done, it was a $15/mo savings, plus the discounted $20 transfer fee) to help compensate for my rough experience. Talk about above and beyond!

If more companies had a social media team that was constantly on the look-out for situations like this, I'd bet customer satisfaction would be higher. Charter, thank you for taking the time to listen to my complaint, and thank you for actually trying to help compensate me properly.
