As many of you know, I work remotely for a company in Wisconsin. I've been
working for them offsite on a part-time basis since August 2009, and started
full-time in June 2010. **2014 Update:** The post has been updated to reflect
some changes over the past few years.

I've had many people question the "at-home" line of work, and what it really
means. A lot of good questions, and more often,
[misconceptions](http://theoatmeal.com/comics/working_home 'Why working from home is both awesome and horrible'),
about working at home have come up, so I'd like to address those.

### Do you work in your boxers/underwear/naked?

No; I get fully dressed every day. I try to keep a daily routine. I wake up at
the same time I would normally, I shower, I get dressed, I make coffee, and I
try to get to my desk by 8:00 AM. The only exception is that I don't wear "work"
clothes; generally just a t-shirt and a pair of jeans.

**2014 Update:** I try to keep it business casual now that video conferencing
has become more accessible and frequent.

### Can't you choose your own hours and work whenever you want?

No, I don't work whenever I want. Similar to the above, I try to work a
consistent, normal schedule. Generally I work Monday â€” Friday, 8:00 AM to 4:00
or 5:00 PM (depending on if I take a lunch or not). Granted, I do have a little
bit more flexibility with my schedule, but my employer tends to be really
flexible to begin with.

Further more, just because I work at home doesn't mean I get to slack off.
Actually, I tend to work more hours at home than I did when I was onsite (I work
approximately 45 hours a week, compared to the 41 or 42 on site).

**2014 Update:** This is still relatively true, though my current employer is
more flexible than any I've had. Love it!

### How do they really know you're working?

I guess honestly, they don't. Besides the fact that the work gets done on time,
I get constant phone calls, emails, and instant messages. There have been some

### rare

circumstances where I've had to flex my schedule a bit and work from my phone
(e.g. when we were in the moving process), but I try to be as honest as possible
on my timesheet.

**2014 Update:** Not that they have to keep tabs on me, but things like IM,
audio and video calls, and more help my coworkers and teammates know when I'm
around and what I'm up to.

### Can't you work wherever you want?

The short answer to this would be: yes. There have been a few occasions where
I've had to work in non-traditional places.

I recall one time in particular where I was sitting out in the grass on a nice
sunny day and a plane flew overhead while I was in a phone conference (with
coworkers, thankfully); they asked what that was, and I had to explain that I
was enjoying then nice sunny weather. Honestly, though, the only reason I was
doing this was because we were in the process of moving, and didn't have a real
desk to sit at.

I have a desk and an office in my house, and I make full use of them.

**2014 Update:** with upgrades in my life, I have a true, dedicated office at
the end of our house. While I _could_ work just about anywhere, I definitely
prefer the comfort of my own office.

### What about communication? Do you find it hard working with people without actually being in the office?

I think I've managed well. I know how to effectively communicate (for the most
part) through any medium. Under most circumstances, I find that I'm more
productive out of the office than in, mainly because it's not as easy for people
to come and ask me a question, interrupting whatever I'm working on. However, if
there is an emergency, I'm very easy to get a hold of via phone.

Also, I like the "queue-like" nature of my current primary communication: email.
A request comes in, and I can prioritize it without having to totally disrupt my
workflow.

Funny story to go with this: I still get the occasional person that doesn't
realize I work remotely. They'll call me asking if I can come and take a look at
their problem, then I have to explain that I'm not actually there. Apparently,
people must think I sneak-in in the morning, hide in back all day, and sneak-out
when it's time to head home.

**2014 Update:** this has changed a lot. Communication has gotten much better,
and we now have tons of options: email, IM, audio and video calls, screen
sharing, whiteboarding, and more (thanks Lync!). The only limiting factor is the
bandwidth that we're communicating on (which in most cases is okay, though it
could be better).

### How do your coworkers know when you're done working?

Like I said, I tend to follow a fairly normal schedule. However, I do find that
working remotely makes me a little more "on-call". There have been times where
I've taken a work phone call as late as 8:00 PM. Also, I've worked as late as
midnight before (not straight, but a 12-hour day is tough) due to a late-night
emergency.

**2014 Update:** with getting better at remote work, and communicating with my
teammates, it's pretty well known when I'm actually working. Outside of those
hours, unless there is an urgent matter, email fills the gap for off hours.

### Likes

There are a lot of things that I enjoy about working remotely. Here are a few in
no particular order:

- Easier breaks: it's a lot easier to walk away from a brain-block, then come
  back to it. I can also do things for my breaks that I wouldn't be able to at
  the office, like pick-up my guitar and play a few notes. Even if it's only for
  a few minutes, it makes all the difference.
- Less stress: I feel like my stress is down compared to working on site. A lot
  of this has to do with me not being submerged into the atmosphere that is
  having the problem, but rather I get to look at it from the outside.
- Home office: I didn't mind working in the cube environment, but I love having
  a home office. I can have my music going, I can decorate it as I choose, set
  it up as I choose, and make my work day more comfortable overall.
- Location, location, location: as I said, the company I work for is located in
  Wisconsin, which is quite a distance away from home. I love being in my home
  town, close to family and old friends.
- The commute: a whole 15 feet.

### Dislikes

Even with working at home being as awesome as it is, there are still a few
things I don't like:

- At home interruptions: if a problem comes up at home, sometimes I get sucked
  into it. I normally try to avoid dealing with it until I'm done working, but
  sometimes you just can't. **2014 Update:** this has been greatly reduced over
  the years now that my family has gotten used to it.
- Communication: even though I said I make the best of the communication
  situation, there are a few times where it would just be better if I was there.
  Thankfully, I'm resourceful enough to get around that problem, and generally
  find a solution. **2014 Update:** as I mentioned above, this has been mostly
  remedied.
- Environment: I do miss out on a lot of coworker-related activities and being
  around my coworkers in general. I have a lot of friends that work there, and
  it would be nice to see them more often. Thankfully, I do get to visit onsite
  every once-and-again.
