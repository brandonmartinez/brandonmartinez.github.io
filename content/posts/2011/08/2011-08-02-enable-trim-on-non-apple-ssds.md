While my iMac came with an Apple-branded SSD, and received TRIM support through OS X Lion, Joy's MacBook Pro does not and did not. This utility enables it: [TRIM Enabler](http://www.groths.org/?page_id=322 "TRIM Enabler").

I'm going to install it on her MBP shortly and see how it works.

\[update\]Looks like it works!
