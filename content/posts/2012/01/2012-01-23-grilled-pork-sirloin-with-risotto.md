Dinner tonight: grilled pork sirloin, garlic and onion risotto, and French-cut green beans, with a slice of artisan Focaccia bread. We had some left over Arborio rice from a seafood party last night, so I thought I would try my hand at it. Overall, it turned out nicely.

Nothing too fancy here, just really tasty. Pork was covered in Badia then grilled, risotto was done "by the box," and the beans were cooked in butter with some salt and pepper. Sometimes simple is the best.
