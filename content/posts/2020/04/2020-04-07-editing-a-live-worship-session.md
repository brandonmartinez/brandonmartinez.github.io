excerpt:
  Due to the current state of quarantine in the US (and specifically for us, in
  Michigan), we've had to get creative in how we gather for our church services.
  We pre-recorded some worship segments to be used in our livestream broadcast
  that happens on Sundays. This is a video of the editing process I used to mix
  one of the songs from that session.

Due to the current state of quarantine in the US (and specifically for us, in
Michigan), we've had to get creative in how we gather for our church services.
We pre-recorded some worship segments to be used in our livestream broadcast
that happens on Sundays. [This is a video](https://youtu.be/uT6kdwh_yCM) of the
editing process I used to mix one of the songs from that session.
