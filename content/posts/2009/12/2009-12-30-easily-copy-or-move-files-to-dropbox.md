If you're an avid Dropbox user like myself, you may find that getting files to your Dropbox folder isn't always the easiest task. If you're rooted deep into the filesystem, sometimes you want a quick way to send a file to your public folder without having leave your current location. Well, now there is an easy to use solution (Mac OS X only).

I have created a set of Mac OS X services that allow you to quickly copy or move files to your Dropbox public folder. You can find them here: [DropboxServices.zip](http://assets.brandonmartinez.com/brandonmartinez/2009/12/DropboxServices.zip "Dropbox Services: Easily Copy and Move Files to your Dropbox Public Folder"). Installation instructions are available in the README file contained in the ZIP archive.

Once you have the services properly installed, they're really simple to use. You right/ctrl-click a file(s), and select _Services_ from the context menu, then either _Copy to Dropbox Public Folder_ or _Move to Dropbox Public Folder_. When the service finishes running, it will automatically open the public folder.

From there, if you would like to share that file's public Dropbox URL you can right-click the file and select _Dropbox_ -> _Copy Public Link_; this puts the link to the file on your clipboard. Paste it in a web browser to preview the file, or pass it along to a friend to share.

Here is a demonstration of using the services (if you'd like to see a large version, you can view it [here](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dqfii_pfz1U)):
